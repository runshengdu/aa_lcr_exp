There is no reason I can see for workers to be forced into non-compete contracts.
I can see the occasional need for upper management in a company needing to sign
such a contract, but forcing the average worker to do so is an abuse of their rights to
work freely and an abuse of the legal system.
It obstructs free movement of individuals and creates a caste-type system of work.
Businesses will naturally try to gain advantage to maximise profit, but this should not
come at the expense of their workers. It should be obtained by maximising innovation
and efficiency. Non-compete clauses are the lazy way for businesses to try to gain
advantage and it is an abuse of their employees.
