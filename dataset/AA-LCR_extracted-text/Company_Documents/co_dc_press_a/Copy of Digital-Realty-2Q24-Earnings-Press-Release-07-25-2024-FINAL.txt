**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**

This document contains non-GAAP financial measures, including FFO, Core FFO, Adjusted FFO, Net Operating Income (NOI), “Same-Capital” Cash NOI
and Adjusted EBITDA. A reconciliation from U.S. GAAP net income available to common stockholders to FFO, a reconciliation from FFO to Core FFO, a
reconciliation from Core FFO to Adjusted FFO, reconciliation from NOI to Cash NOI, and definitions of FFO, Core FFO, Adjusted FFO, NOI and “SameCapital” Cash NOI are included as an attachment to this document. A reconciliation from U.S. GAAP net income available to common stockholders to
Adjusted EBITDA, a definition of Adjusted EBITDA and definitions of net debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA, debt-plus-preferred-to-total enterprise value, cash
NOI, and fixed charge coverage ratio are included as an attachment to this document.

The Company does not provide a reconciliation for non-GAAP estimates on a forward-looking basis, where it is unable to provide a meaningful or
accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items and the information is not available without unreasonable effort. This is due to the inherent
difficulty of forecasting the timing and/or amount of various items that would impact net income attributable to common stockholders per diluted
share, which is the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measure. This includes, for example, external growth factors, such as
dispositions, and balance sheet items such as debt issuances, that have not yet occurred, are out of the Company's control and/or cannot be reasonably
predicted. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. Forward-looking non-GAAP
financial measures provided without the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures may vary materially from the corresponding GAAP financial
measures.

(2) Certain of Teraco's minority indirect shareholders have the right to put their shares in an upstream parent company of Teraco to Digital Realty in exchange for cash or the equivalent value
of shares of Digital Realty common stock, or a combination thereof. US GAAP requires Digital Realty to assume the put right is settled in shares for purposes of calculating diluted EPS. This
same approach was utilized to calculate FFO/share. The potential future dilutive impact associated with this put right will be excluded from Core FFO and AFFO until settlement occurs –
causing diluted share count to be higher for FFO than for Core FFO and AFFO. When calculating diluted FFO, Teraco related minority interest is added back to the FFO numerator as the
denominator assumes all shares have been put back to Digital Realty.

**Definitions**

**Funds From Operations (FFO):**
We calculate funds from operations, or FFO, in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts
(Nareit) in the Nareit Funds From Operations White Paper - 2018 Restatement. FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents net income (loss)
(computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gain (loss) from the disposition of real estate assets, provision for impairment, real estate related
depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs), our share of unconsolidated JV real estate related depreciation &
amortization, net income attributable to non-controlling interests in operating partnership and, depreciation related to non-controlling interests.
Management uses FFO as a supplemental performance measure because, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and
losses from property dispositions and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, it provides a performance measure that,
when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. We also believe that, as a widely recognized
measure of the performance of REITs, FFO will be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs. However,
because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our data centers that result from use or market
conditions, nor the level of capital expenditures and capitalized leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our data
centers, all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our financial condition and results from operations, the utility of FFO as a
measure of our performance is limited. Other REITs may not calculate FFO in accordance with the Nareit definition and, accordingly, our FFO may not be
comparable to other REITs’ FFO. FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our
performance.

**Core Funds from Operations (Core FFO):**
We present core funds from operations, or Core FFO, as a supplemental operating measure because, in excluding certain items that do not reflect core
revenue or expense streams, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in our core business operating
performance. We calculate Core FFO by adding to or subtracting from FFO (i) other non-core revenue adjustments, (ii) transaction and integration
expenses, (iii) loss from early extinguishment of debt, (iv) gain on / issuance costs associated with redeemed preferred stock, (v) severance, equity
acceleration and legal expenses, (vi) gain/loss on FX revaluation, and (vii) other non-core expense adjustments. Because certain of these adjustments
have a real economic impact on our financial condition and results from operations, the utility of Core FFO as a measure of our performance is limited.
Other REITs may calculate Core FFO differently than we do and accordingly, our Core FFO may not be comparable to other REITs’ Core FFO. Core FFO
should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance.

**Adjusted Funds from Operations (AFFO):**
We present adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, as a supplemental operating measure because, when compared year over year, it assesses our
ability to fund dividend and distribution requirements from our operating activities. We also believe that, as a widely recognized measure of the
operations of REITs, AFFO will be used by investors as a basis to assess our ability to fund dividend payments in comparison to other REITs, including on
a per share and unit basis. We calculate AFFO by adding to or subtracting from Core FFO (i) non-real estate depreciation, (ii) amortization of deferred
financing costs, (iii) amortization of debt discount/premium, (iv) non-cash stock-based compensation expense, (v) straight-line rental revenue,
(vi) straight-line rental expense, (vii) above- and below-market rent amortization, (viii) deferred tax expense / (benefit), (ix) leasing compensation and
internal lease commissions, and (x) recurring capital expenditures. Other REITs may calculate AFFO differently than we do and, accordingly, our AFFO
may not be comparable to other REITs’ AFFO. AFFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a
measure of our performance.

**EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:**
We believe that earnings before interest, loss from early extinguishment of debt, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, and
Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below), are useful supplemental performance measures because they allow investors to view our performance without the
impact of non-cash depreciation and amortization or the cost of debt and, with respect to Adjusted EBITDA, (i) unconsolidated joint venture real estate
related depreciation & amortization, (ii) unconsolidated joint venture interest expense and tax, (iii) severance, equity acceleration and legal expenses,
(iv) transaction and integration expenses, (v) gain (loss) on sale / deconsolidation, (vi) provision for impairment, (vii) other non-core adjustments, net,
(viii) non-controlling interests, (ix) preferred stock dividends, and (x) issuance costs associated with redeemed preferred stock. Adjusted EBITDA is
EBITDA excluding (i) unconsolidated joint venture real estate related depreciation & amortization, (ii) unconsolidated joint venture interest expense and
tax, (iii) severance, equity acceleration and legal expenses, (iv) transaction and integration expenses, (v) gain (loss) on sale / deconsolidation, (vi)
provision for impairment, (vii) other non-core adjustments, net, (vii) non-controlling interests, (ix) preferred stock dividends, and (x) gain on / issuance
costs associated with redeemed preferred stock. In addition, we believe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are frequently used by securities analysts,
investors, and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs. Because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are calculated before recurring cash charges
including interest expense and income taxes, exclude capitalized costs, such as leasing commissions, and are not adjusted for capital expenditures or
other recurring cash requirements of our business, their utility as a measure of our performance is limited. Other REITs may calculate EBITDA and
Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do and, accordingly, our EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other REITs’ EBITDA and Adjusted
EBITDA. Accordingly, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should be considered only as supplements to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a
measure of our financial performance.

**Net Operating Income (NOI) and Cash NOI:**
Net operating income, or NOI, represents rental revenue, tenant reimbursement revenue and interconnection revenue less utilities expense, rental
property operating expenses, property taxes and insurance expenses (as reflected in the statement of operations). NOI is commonly used by
stockholders, company management and industry analysts as a measurement of operating performance of the company’s rental portfolio. Cash NOI is
NOI less straight-line rents and above- and below-market rent amortization. Cash NOI is commonly used by stockholders, company management and
industry analysts as a measure of property operating performance on a cash basis. Same-Capital Cash NOI represents buildings owned as of December
31, 2022 of the prior year with less than 5% of total rentable square feet under development and excludes buildings that were undergoing, or were
expected to undergo, development activities in 2023-2024, buildings classified as held for sale, and buildings sold or contributed to joint ventures for all
periods presented (prior period numbers adjusted to reflect current same-capital pool). However, because NOI and cash NOI exclude depreciation and
amortization and capture neither the changes in the value of our data centers that result from use or market conditions, nor the level of capital
expenditures and capitalized leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our data centers, all of which have real economic
effect and could materially impact our results from operations, the utility of NOI and cash NOI as measures of our performance is limited. Other REITs
may calculate NOI and cash NOI differently than we do and, accordingly, our NOI and cash NOI may not be comparable to other REITs’ NOI and cash
NOI. NOI and cash NOI should be considered only as supplements to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as measures of our performance.

**Additional Definitions**

Net debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA ratio is calculated as total debt at balance sheet carrying value, plus capital lease obligations, plus Digital Realty’s pro rata share of
unconsolidated joint venture debt, less cash and cash equivalents (including Digital Realty’s pro rata share of unconsolidated joint venture cash) divided by the product of
Adjusted EBITDA (including Digital Realty’s pro rata share of unconsolidated joint venture EBITDA), multiplied by four.

Debt-plus-preferred-to-total enterprise value is total debt plus preferred stock divided by total debt plus the liquidation value of preferred stock and the market value of
outstanding Digital Realty Trust, Inc. common stock and Digital Realty Trust, L.P. units, assuming the redemption of Digital Realty Trust, L.P. units for shares of Digital Realty
Trust, Inc. common stock.

Fixed charge coverage ratio is Adjusted EBITDA divided by the sum of GAAP interest expense, capitalized interest and preferred stock dividends. For the quarter ended
June 30, 2024, GAAP interest expense was $115 million, capitalized interest was $28 million and preferred stock dividends was $10 million.
