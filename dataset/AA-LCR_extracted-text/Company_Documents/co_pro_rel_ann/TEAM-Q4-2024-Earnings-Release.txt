**Team Anywhere/San Francisco (August 1, 2024) — Atlassian Corporation (NASDAQ: TEAM), a leading provider of**
team collaboration and productivity software, today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year
2024. A shareholder letter was posted on Atlassian’s Work Life blog at http://atlassian.com/blog/announcements/
shareholder-letter-q4fy24 and in the Investor Relations section of Atlassian’s website at https://investors.atlassian.com.

**Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Results**

“This past year we’ve once again proved to ourselves that we can accomplish big things. We grew revenue to $4.4
billion, generated free cash flow of over $1.4 billion, and surged past 300,000 customers.

“We announced transformative innovations for our customers like Rovo, the latest human-AI technology reshaping the
way we work. We achieved significant milestones like FedRAMP’s “In Process” status, a huge step towards supporting
the U.S. public sector in the cloud, and we wound down support for Server,” said Mike Cannon-Brookes, Atlassian’s cofounder and co-CEO.

“With this setup, we feel tremendously optimistic about what is ahead of us. We’re excited to build on this momentum
and get cracking on FY25,” concluded Cannon-Brookes.

“When I look back on the last 23 years, I am filled with pride at what two mates from Australia built,” said Scott
Farquhar, Atlassian’s co-founder and co-CEO. “We created a global company with over 12,000 employees, tens of
thousands of champions across the Atlassian ecosystem, and over 300,000 customers. We’ve helped companies big
and small all over the world solve some of the most interesting and challenging problems - from the development of
electric vehicles and life-saving medical advancements to space exploration. And yet our best days are still ahead.

“I leave the co-CEO role knowing Atlassian is incredibly well-positioned to capitalize on the huge opportunities ahead
and live its mission of unleashing the potential of every team. I look forward to continuing along the journey, albeit from
a slightly different seat,” concluded Farquhar.

circumstances after the date of this press release or to reflect new information or the occurrence of unanticipated
events, except as required by law.

The achievement or success of the matters covered by such forward-looking statements involves known and unknown

**About Non-GAAP Financial Measures**

In addition to the measures presented in our consolidated financial statements, we regularly review other measures
that are not presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), defined as nonGAAP financial measures by the SEC, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends, prepare
financial forecasts and make strategic decisions. The key measures we consider are non-GAAP gross profit and nonGAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP
net income per diluted share and free cash flow (collectively, the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures”). These Non-GAAP
Financial Measures, which may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies, provide


-----

Measures provides management, our board of directors, investors and the analyst community with the ability to better
evaluate matters such as: our ongoing core operations, including comparisons between periods and against other
companies in our industry; our ability to generate cash to service our debt and fund our operations; and the underlying
business trends that are affecting our performance.

Our Non-GAAP Financial Measures include:

-  _Non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin. Excludes expenses related to stock-based_
compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and restructuring charges.

-  _Non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin. Excludes expenses related to stock-based_
compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and restructuring charges.

-  _Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share. Excludes expenses related to stock-_
based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, restructuring charges, gain on a non-cash
sale of a controlling interest of a subsidiary, and the related income tax adjustments.

-  _Free cash flow. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures,_
which consists of purchases of property and equipment.

We understand that although these Non-GAAP Financial Measures are frequently used by investors and the analyst
community in their evaluation of our financial performance, these measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you
should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. We
compensate for such limitations by reconciling these Non-GAAP Financial Measures to the most comparable GAAP
financial measures. We encourage you to review the tables in this press release titled “Reconciliation of GAAP to NonGAAP Results” and “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Targets” that present such reconciliations.

**Customers with >$10,000 in Cloud ARR**

We define the number of customers with Cloud ARR greater than $10,000 at the end of any particular period as the
number of organizations with unique domains with an active Cloud subscription for two or more seats and greater than
$10,000 in Cloud ARR.

We define Cloud ARR as the annualized recurring revenue run-rate of Cloud subscription agreements at a point in
time. We calculate Cloud ARR by taking the Cloud monthly recurring revenue (“Cloud MRR”) run-rate and multiplying it
by 12. Cloud MRR for each month is calculated by aggregating monthly recurring revenue from committed contractual
amounts at a point in time. Cloud ARR and Cloud MRR should be viewed independently of revenue and do not
represent our revenue under GAAP, as they are operational metrics that can be affected by contract start and end
dates and renewal rates.

(2) In fiscal year 2024, we began to utilize a fixed long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate in our computation of the non-GAAP income tax
adjustments in order to provide better consistency across interim reporting periods. In projecting this long-term non-GAAP tax rate, we utilized a
three-year financial projection that excludes the direct and indirect income tax effects of the other non-GAAP adjustments reflected above.
Additionally, we considered our current operating structure and other factors such as our existing tax positions in various jurisdictions and key
legislation in major jurisdictions where we operate. For fiscal year 2024, we determined the projected non-GAAP tax rate to be 27%. This fixed
long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate eliminates the effects of non-recurring and period specific items which can vary in size and frequency.
Examples of the non-recurring and period specific items include but are not limited to changes in the valuation allowance related to deferred tax
assets, effects resulting from acquisitions, and unusual or infrequently occurring items. We will periodically re-evaluate this long-term rate, as
necessary, for significant events. The rate could be subject to change for a variety of reasons, for example, significant changes in the geographic
earnings mix or fundamental tax law changes in major jurisdictions where the company operates.

(3) The effects of these dilutive securities were not included in the GAAP calculation of diluted net loss per share for the three months and fiscal
years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.
