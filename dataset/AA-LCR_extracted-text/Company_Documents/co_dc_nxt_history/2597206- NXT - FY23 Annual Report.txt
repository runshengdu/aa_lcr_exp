Welcome to NEXTDC’s Annual Report for the fiscal year
ended 30 June, 2023. It has been another outstanding
12 months for the Company with our key financial
metrics once again showing record growth during the
reporting period.

The ongoing scaling of our national platform and
expansion into Asia has been driven by a focussed
commitment from our team and its leadership. They
have driven the growth of our business and taken
colocation revenues, interconnection, ecosystem
development, EBITDA and contracted utilisation to
new heights.

In an environment where macro-economic forces such
as rising geo-political tensions, supply chain constraints
and rising inflation have created domestic and
international disruption, the demand for digital

Adelaide and Darwin as well as key customer-driven
edge opportunities such as in Port Hedland and
Newman in Western Australia, where the resources
sector continues to be focussed on seeking business
advantage from digital transformation.

One of the pleasing developments in FY23 was our
May announcement that we are executing on our Asian
growth strategy, with our first Malaysian data centre
being the A$1 billion development of the Kuala Lumpur
(KL1) facility.

Kuala Lumpur is an ideal location for NEXTDC to launch
its Asian expansion. With subsea fibre optic cable and
new global satellite communications infrastructure
being deployed at this location, Malaysia is within
milliseconds of all the key economic centres in the
region.

Its location, stable democracy, well-educated
population, historic English language and governance
rules, and commitment to economic development
makes it ideal for us to help accelerate our customers’
digital journey.

With the exception of mature markets like Singapore
and Australia, the Asian countries of interest to us are
at a much earlier stage in their digital transformation.
Without question, the pathway of a developing digital
economy requires significant investment in digital
infrastructure that NEXTDC can profitably contribute to.

It is with great confidence that we forge ahead with
the development of our first overseas data centres in

Funded for growth

Having upsized NEXTDC’s debt facilities in FY23 by an incremental A$400 million to A$2.9 billion, as well as having
raised an additional A$618 million in equity, we are well-funded for the growth opportunities before us.

Our strategy continues to be centred on supporting the growth requirements of existing customers, both
domestically and now internationally. NEXTDC has strong relationships with key customers and the decision makers
who make deployment decisions both in Australia and Asia.

Our company has world competitive technology and engineering design intellectual property with a differentiated
offering that is as relevant in key Asian markets as it is in Australia. Accordingly, we are confident that the business is
well placed to win an attractive share of the rising opportunities in these markets.

As customers become even more dependent on the resilience, security and interconnection of their digital
infrastructure, the relevance of our value proposition continues to be enhanced. Our third-generation facilities at S3
Sydney and M3 Melbourne offer unrivalled flexibility in the spaces available for our customers. Our independently
certified Tier IV sites deliver a level of fault tolerance that allows us to offer our 100% uptime guarantee. These are
strategic differentiators that are valued by our customers.

Our third generation M3 Melbourne data centre in West Footscray is now fully operational.

I am pleased to present to you NEXTDC s Annual Report
for the financial year ended 30 June 2023. It has been
another extraordinary year of growth and achievement,
driven by our unwavering commitment to the pursuit of
excellence, delivering the world’s highest standard of
data centre and interconnection services.

The strong financial metrics in this annual report along
with the record-breaking level of new sales in FY23 lock
in a solid rate of growth over the next decade as we
deliver these very large infrastructure projects for our
customers for many years to come.

Digital acceleration

The increasing digitisation of businesses as well as the
exponential growth of data capture, sharing, storage
and analysis have combined to create a thriving digital
economy. Forbes estimates that approximately 90% of
the world’s data has been generated in just the past
two years, with over 2.5 quintillion bytes of additional

39.2MW (47%) to finish the year with 122.2MW in total.
Pleasingly, this demand came from a broad range of
industries including hyperscale cloud providers, financial
services, mining, retail, satellite communications,
government, media and entertainment. We were also
successful renewing and expanding service contracts
with pre-existing customers during the reporting period
based on our ongoing service quality.

Opportunity knocks

We are in the beginning of the fourth industrial
revolution. Change is happening at an unprecedented
rate, and with innovation cycles shortening, we find
ourselves at the precipice of unprecedented digital
economic growth. This is further fuelled everyday by AI,
which itself is accelerating other megatrends such as
robotics, virtual reality, 5G, the Internet of Things and
many more.

Ubiquitous and democratised technology adoption is
and will continue to drive an explosion of global data
with commerce and lifestyle evolutions taking digital
services into exciting new frontiers.

Increasingly, colocation services, cloud platforms and
interconnection services are enabling organisations to
leverage these capabilities rapidly, sustainably and
without the traditional time to build and capital
constraints.

As a leading player in this industry, we are well-
positioned to leverage this growth and continue to

AI and megatrends driving pipeline and
influencing strategic direction

We have identified several key megatrends shaping the
industry and influencing our strategic direction. Trends
such as AI, augmented reality, 5G, IoT, 3D printing, and
cloud computing are converging to form a new wave of
innovation.

By aligning our business strategy and services with
these megatrends, we are poised to stay ahead of the
curve and deliver the innovative solutions our
customers need now and into the future.

Demand forecasts continue to surge

The data centre services industry continues to
experience remarkable growth and presents abundant
opportunities for NEXTDC, our customers and partners.
[Research company, Arizton’s latest market report,](https://www.arizton.com/market-reports/australia-data-center-market-investment-analysis)
forecast Australia’s data centre industry to grow at a
compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.1% during
[2022-2028, while ResearchAndMarkets predicts that](https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/5740677/asia-pacific-data-centre-market-size)
the Asia-Pacific Data Centre Market will reach
US$53.58 billion in 2028 and expand at a CAGR of 12%
from 2023 to 2028.

We have spent 12 years developing a world class
service offering as well as a unique customer
ecosystem and we have a successful business model
in Australia that has proven to be scalable and that is
ready to expand into the broader Asia-Pacific region.

During FY23, we purchased land and made
announcements for new data centre developments in
Kuala Lumpur and Auckland. We look forward to sharing
further such developments in the years ahead as we
take advantage of the growth opportunities in Asia
Pacific markets.

Domestic growth

Building on our strong foundation, we continue to scale
our platform domestically. We saw new, state-of-theart, hyperscale facilities opened in Sydney (S3) and
Melbourne (M3) in the first half of FY23. More recently,
we also completed construction of an Innovation
Centre that is home to our new Mission Critical
Operations (MCX) services in M2 Melbourne.

Stage 2 of S3 also reached practical completion in
FY23, giving us capacity to serve immediate record


customer growth requirements and to meet forecast
future demand. To take advantage of growth
opportunities, we also purchased land for the
development of M4 in Port Melbourne, S5 in Macquarie
Park (Sydney) as well as new mining industry driven
edge sites in Port Hedland and Newman (Western
Australia).

Construction of PH1 Port Hedland and A1 Adelaide
commenced during FY23. D1 Darwin also progressed
and will be the most advanced modular data centre
designed and built by NEXTDC yet, with site works and
module delivery during 1H24 that will be open in
Q4 FY24. NEXTDC’s third Edge Data Centre (NE1
Newman) began development in early FY24, shortly
after the land was secured. All four of these new sites
are expected to go live during FY24 or early FY25.

Opportunity in Asia Pacific

Meanwhile, digital growth in Asia is tracking ahead of
global averages, which is why the development of our
KL1 Kuala Lumpur, and AK1 Auckland data centres
represent significant new frontiers.

As we expand across the region, we will continue to
deliver the same sustainability innovations and critical
infrastructure standards that have been the foundations
of our success to date.

Commitment to safety

At NEXTDC, we continue to place the highest priority
on the safety of our operations. We strive tirelessly to
ensure every team member, contractor, customer, and
visitor is safe whilst at one of our facilities.

We have a proactive safety program implemented to
provide a safe and healthy working environment as
evidenced by our ISO 45001 (Health and Safety)
certification. We manage a range of initiatives to
mitigate the risks associated with both our construction
projects as well as our operational facilities
management.

We empower all employees and contractors to act in a
safe manner and to be an active advocate on safety
issues. We seek out global best practices through
these engagements and with our customers, industry
and WHS peak bodies with the aim of achieving our
Safety-First goal of zero injuries in the workplace.

Sustainability more important than ever

Operating to the highest standards of energy
efficiency, water preservation and waste management
have been priorities for NEXTDC from its foundation.
We are committed to building an infrastructure platform
that is reliable, secure and highly energy efficient.

Our strong emphasis on energy efficiency and
sustainability must be achieved without compromising
world-class operational excellence. Our aggressive
sustainability targets will be supported by design and
operational innovation to reduce and optimise power
consumption.

We continue to invest in improving water efficiency and
waste management. Early in FY24 we were pleased to
receive the TRUE Certification level for our S1 Sydney
facility. This is only granted by independent body, Green
Business Certification Inc. to companies that can
demonstrate they have held a land-fill waste diversion
rate of over 90% for a full 12-month period.

We seek to design, build and operate the most energy
efficient digital platform in the country. NEXTDC has
been certified as carbon neutral for its own internal
operations since 2018. In 2021 we launched
NEXTneutral allowing customers to offset the carbon
footprint of their digital infrastructure in our facilities
through our ONEDC infrastructure management portal.
It is an accessible and easily self-provisioned solution
costing customers less than a cup of coffee per kW of
power usage.

Innovation is in our DNA

Innovation is and always has been at the core of our
business. In FY23, NEXTDC continued to be recognised
for global industry leadership in data centre
engineering, customer experience and energy
efficiency. We continue to invest in our Uptime Institute
(UI) Tier III certification for first-generation facilities and
Tier IV certification for the design, construction, and
operations for our second and third generation sites.

Both S3 and M3 have now undergone and received Tier
IV certification which continues to help us set the
benchmark for the world’s highest quality, resiliency
and operational standards.


Award recognition

More broadly, the industry continues to recognise our
achievements in engineering and operational
excellence. NEXTDC was recently recognised for the
third consecutive year as Frost & Sullivan’s 2023
Australian Data Centre Services Company of the Year.
This award was presented for NEXTDC’s expertise in
the industry and our dedication to customer
experience.

Supporting the Company’s international growth
ambitions, we were also pleased to be awarded with
Frost & Sullivan’s 2023 Asia-Pacific Customer Value
Leadership Award. This award similarly recognised
NEXTDC’s innovation, product portfolio, energy
efficiency and operational excellence.

FY24 strategic priorities and key initiatives

Our goal is to continue winning new business by
leading the hybrid computing revolution and taking our
proven interconnection and infrastructure services into
new markets across the Asia-Pacific. We will continue
to demonstrate industry leadership through innovation,
operational and technical excellence, and ecosystem
strength to make us the premier marketplace for the
digital economy.

In conclusion, I am extremely proud of our team and
their FY23 achievements. We remain dedicated to
delivering exceptional services to our customers,
meeting their evolving needs and driving innovation in
the industry.

I would also like to express my sincere gratitude to our
investors for their continued support, as well as the
guidance we receive from our Board of Directors and
the dedication of our outstanding team members.

I have complete confidence that, together, we will
continue to grow our share of this exciting market and
build the infrastructure that powers the digital
economy.

Strategy

NEXTDC’s aim is to offer customers Australia’s most energy efficient, sustainably managed data centre services. This
core objective is supported by high standards of engineering, design and operational excellence. Climate-related
issues and their impact on data centre performance are intrinsically linked to NEXTDC’s business strategy and
financial performance.

In FY21, NEXTDC undertook a process to identify the climate-related risks and opportunities for its business,
strategy, and financial planning. Both physical and transition risks and opportunities were identified using the TCFD
framework. This work continued in FY22 as the Company further defined its climate related performance metrics.

Scenario analysis

In FY23, NEXTDC deepened its understanding of the impacts of climate change on its operations by conducting its
first scenario analysis exercise. This consisted of a qualitative assessment of how climate risks and opportunities may
change under future scenarios based on high level assumptions of how the energy and the physical climate system
might evolve in the future. Three scenarios were selected by NEXTDC to conduct its climate scenario analysis with
respect to the level of warming compared to pre-industrial levels. The scenarios and their inputs and assumptions are
summarised in the table below.

section above).

NEXTDC intends to continue the journey to convert its operational performance ambitions for efficiency and
energy usage into short/medium GHG reduction targets. Ultimately the aim is to develop a net zero
pathway quantifying the Company’s full value chain to 2030 and beyond. NEXTDC recognises this is a major
ambition and is committed to disclosing its roadmap to net zero, taking into consideration its operational,
regulatory and legislative constraints in a competitive market.

Funding and financial position

In FY23, NEXTDC secured an incremental $400 million in
senior debt capacity, bringing the facility to a new
aggregate limit of $2.9 billion, as well as favourable
amendments to existing financial covenants and terms.
The additional debt capacity is expected to provide
NEXTDC with additional headroom to fund its medium to
longer term growth aspirations.

Details of the new facility limits are summarised as follows:

-  $800 million – Term Loan Facility

-  $600 million – Capital Expenditure Facility

-  $800 million – Revolving Credit Facility (multicurrency)

-  $300 million – Term Loan Facility

-  $100 million – New Term Loan Facility

-  $300 million – New Revolving Credit Facility

The $100 million New Term Loan Facility was drawn down
in February 2023.


Cash and cash equivalents at 30 June 2023 totalled $766
million (2022: $457 million), which combined with the
undrawn senior syndicated debt facility of $1.5 billion, gave
the Group access to $2.3 billion in available liquidity at 30
June 2023.

NEXTDC’s balance sheet position is underpinned by
approximately $3.8 billion in total assets.

Sales performance

We have continued to focus our sales strategy on
partnering with providers of infrastructure, platforms and
packaged services. The flexibility we offer by being carrier
and vendor neutral allows customers a choice of carriers
and systems integrators, leading to an increase in the
number of unique customers to 1,820 at 30 June 2023 (up
from 1,613 at 30 June 2022).

During the year NEXTDC increased its contracted
utilisation by 47% from 83.0MW at the end of FY22 to
122.2MW at the end of FY23.

NSW/ACT’s contracted utilisation increased by 38.5MW
during FY23 to 80.8MW as at 30 June 2023, with contracted
utilisation accounting for 126% of built capacity (64.0MW).


-----

Our contracted utilisation in Victoria fell slightly by 0.2MW to
33.1MW during the period from 1 July 2022 to 30 June
2023 as our first material order at M1 Melbourne moved from
a wholesale to rack order with contracted utilisation
accounting for 62% of built capacity (53.5MW).

Contracted utilisation for the rest of Australia grew 0.8MW
during FY23 to 8.2MW as at 30 June 2023, with contracted
utilisation accounting for 51% of built capacity (15.9MW).

We are earning revenue from numerous products including
white space, rack ready, project fees and value-added
services. During FY23 interconnection generated 7.1% of
total recurring revenue.

NEXTDC continues to develop its go-to-market strategy
through channel partnerships with major
telecommunications and IT service providers, allowing it to
increase the breadth and depth of its selling capability
without adding to its sales operating cost base.

Continuous innovation

As an organisation in Australia’s rapidly growing IT
infrastructure sector, it is essential that NEXTDC seek the
continuous development and innovation of its systems,
products and services.

All data centres have achieved and continue to be certified
to ISO 27001 Information Security Management System,
ISO 9001 Quality Management System, ISO 14001
Environmental Management System and most recently the
ISO 45001 for WHS Management System. These
certifications confirm that NEXTDC has an integrated
management system that provides a systematic approach
to risk management, protection of company information
and continuous improvement. An exception to this is
NEXTDC’s edge data centre in the Sunshine Coast (SC1)
and the newly established S3 Sydney and M3 Melbourne
facilities who are already operated in line with national
standards. Our intention is to complete this process within
the next 12 months, where this is applicable to the service
we provide.

Ongoing customer demand has seen NEXTDC develop
innovative ways to augment data centre capacity beyond
the original designs, with the addition of higher power
densities and the development of additional data halls.
Even though power consumption is increasing as our
facilities become more populated, their overall energy
efficiency has improved over time through economies of
scale and increased utilisation of existing infrastructure.

NEXTDC has a continuous process of testing and tuning its
data centres to optimise energy efficiency and stability
to ensure that Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) targets
are achieved. The average PUE throughout the year
across all NEXTDC data centres, is now 1.39, exceeding
our target of 1.40 and comparing very favourably with the
Australian and Global industry average.


Energy efficiency and sustainability remain key areas of
focus for the Group. Our data centre facilities have been
engineered to deliver extremely high energy efficiency,
lowering the carbon footprint for our customers. Our M1
Melbourne and S1 Sydney data centres were the first data
centres in Australia to achieve a National Australian Built
Environment Rating System (NABERS) 5-Star rating for
energy efficiency. In FY23, we included our P1 Perth
facility in the NABERs certification portfolio, achieving a
4.5-star rating. NEXTDC’s second-generation data
centres are already delivering very high levels of energy
efficiency, enabled by next-generation engineering and
continuous tuning, which is aimed at setting new levels of
energy efficiency. Our third-generation data centres, made
operational in FY23, are expected to raise the bar to a
whole new level.

As facilities approach full capacity and incremental cooling
infrastructure is no longer needed, rooftop solar becomes
an option at some of the more mature sites. NEXTDC owns
and operates its own solar array on the roof of its M1
data centre and has also been a Principal Partner to the
Melbourne Renewable Energy Project (MREP) since its
inception in 2014. In FY23, another 300kW of solar panels
went live on our S1 rooftop, and a 17kW solar panel, having
been installed on the SC1 rooftop, went live in August 2023.
Additionally, the installation of solar panels on our M3
(60kW) and P1 (198kW) rooftops is now complete and will
be operational in the next few months.

Business strategies and prospects
for future financial years

The Group continues to develop its strong and growing
pipeline of sales opportunities across each of its operating
markets. Based on the number of positive utilisation
trends such as cloud and mobile computing, growth in
internet traffic and data sovereignty, we expect that
demand for carrier and vendor neutral outsourced data
centre services will continue to grow strongly for the
foreseeable future.

The Company has a number of strategies to benefit from
this growth including but not limited to:

-  Continuing to sell capacity in existing facilities;

-  Growing its presence in existing data centre markets
where its existing facilities are close to being fully
utilised;

-  Expanding its footprint into new data centre markets in
Australia such as Adelaide, Darwin, Port Hedland and
Newman;

-  Expanding its presence into new offshore markets
such as New Zealand and Malaysia; and

-  Launch of new products.

Based on the factors listed above, the Group expects its
revenue to continue growing in the foreseeable future.

Business risks

NEXTDC’s risk management framework is an integral
component of its corporate governance and central to
achieving its strategic and operational objectives.

NEXTDC continues to review its enterprise risks against
the Board endorsed Risk Appetite Statement. We have
implemented systems and processes to identify risks at an
early stage to ensure they are managed accordingly. The
responsibilities, objectives, and processes of risk
management are described in our internal Risk
Management Procedure and guidelines. Further details on
NEXTDC’s Risk Management Framework can be found in
the Company’s most recent Corporate Governance
Statement which can be located at the Company’s website
(www.nextdc.com).

The following key business risks have remained focus
areas, as they can adversely affect the Company’s
financial performance:

**Business Management and Governance**

-  _Fraud, Bribery and Corruption:_ Fraud, bribery or any
other unethical behaviour could significantly impact the
trust and confidence of NEXTDC’s customers,
shareholders and other stakeholders. NEXTDC’s
Board approved Statement of Delegated Authority is
embedded within all levels of NEXTDC’s business
processes. All NEXTDC staff and Directors undergo
Code of Conduct training and pursuant to the
Company’s Whistleblower Policy, employees are
encouraged to come forward and report if they see
any unethical behaviour.

-  _Training and Development: Operating and maintaining_
data centres requires highly trained employees and
lack of sufficient training and development could result
in safety and environmental incidents, efficiencies and
low morale. Along with the broader Company-wide
training and development program, all data centre
operations staff receive on the job training and
refreshers as required.

-  _Technology Advances:_ NEXTDC operates in a
competitive sector. Any failure to keep up with the
latest technology or not having the business systems
that support the scale and pace of business
expansion could result in reputational damage and a
downturn in customer demand. To mitigate this risk,
the Company promotes mutual research and
development projects and strategic alliances with its
suppliers, regularly attends industry conferences and
is a member of the Uptime Institute, an independent
thought leader and certification body in IT and data
centres. NEXTDC’s Business Transformation Program
has been established to support initiatives that ensure
the business evolves to meet the ongoing needs of its
customers.

-  _Employee Engagement: Having an engaged workforce_
is vital to achieving our strategic objectives. It enables
us to attract and retain workers who share the same
purpose, values and goals. NEXTDC is invested in
increasing employee engagement and managing
turnover. Among others, NEXTDC’s ‘The Way We
Work’ program continues to provide ongoing flexibility to
our team, recognising there is no one-size-fits-all
solution to how we work. More details on our social
sustainability initiatives are noted in the FY23
Environmental Social and Governance Report, which
can be located under the Corporate Governance


_Workplace, Health and Safety:_ Employees are
NEXTDC’s most important assets and ensuring they
are healthy and safe is our top priority. We are
committed to providing and maintaining a safe and
healthy working environment for all our employees,
customers, and visitors. We continue to look for new
ways to achieve our Safety-First corporate goal of
ZERO injuries within the workplace. Incident prevention
is of utmost importance and vital to safety and
ultimately, the success of the organisation. All NEXTDC
facilities, with the exception of our SC1 facility in the
Sunshine Coast and the newly established S3 Sydney
and M3 Melbourne facilities, are certified to ISO 45001,
WHS Management System certification.
NEXTDC maintained positive safety results for FY23,
with the Company not recording any lost time injuries
(LTIFR) across its data centre operations.
Active management of WHS issues both in the
operation of data centres and in their development is
mandated and central to creating a culture where it is
safe to speak up and report any hazards or incidents.
NEXTDC has also sought to implement a process of
continual review and improvement through its safety
assurance programs with the team’s performance and
safety initiatives reported to the Board.
This includes the added focus on mental health. Our
strategy for providing a safe workplace also focuses on
protecting people from harm by identifying and
managing workplace risks to mental health; building
capacity to respond and support people experiencing
mental ill-health and promoting positive mental health
and wellbeing. To further evolve our approach to
promoting positive mental health in the workplace and
providing support to team members we have trained
volunteer Mental Health First Aid Officers (MHFAO) at
our facilities who may be able to offer help to someone
experiencing a mental health problem. Our MHFAOs
have successfully completed a Mental Health First Aid
course delivered by an accredited instructor and hold a
current Mental Health First Aid Australia certificate. To
date, we have 33 volunteer MHFAOs across our sites
who are passionate about mental health and supporting
their peers.
As we continue to invest in mental health and team
safety, we engaged health services provider Sonder in
early FY23 to promote organisational wellbeing and
implement additional safety programs.
Sonder provides our people and their families with realtime access to a team of medical, mental health and
safety experts that are ready to assist with their
wellbeing needs, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
NEXTDC’s Construction Safety Management System
continues to benchmark its safety performance and
activities during the construction of our new data
facilities. NEXTDC continues to improve the standard
of our new facilities by embracing lessons learned
during the design, construction and operational phases
of all our sites. Our Safety in Design process captures
these lessons, to be reviewed by every project team as
part of our site design process and to ensure they are
addressed with engineering solutions, as far as
possible. This process promotes improved systems
and capabilities that strengthen our safety performance
and culture. Our ultimate goal is zero injuries.


-----

_Energy Usage and Emissions: NEXTDC is dedicated to_
devising and monitoring the best methods of managing
data centres to ensure energy efficiency and minimise
impact on the environment and our natural resources. It is
the nature of our business that, as our customer loads
increase, so will our own energy usage and emission. Our
facilities are designed, engineered, and operated to
optimise their energy efficiency. NEXTDC has invested
significantly in improving energy efficiencies by focussing
on its environmental objectives, operational efficiencies
and best in class data centre designs. NEXTDC is
committed to achieving NABERS certified rating for our
data centres, with each data centre having a target Power
Usage Effectiveness (PUE) rating to be as energy efficient
as possible. In FY23, we achieved a national average PUE
of 1.39, a figure which compares very favourably with the
Australian and Global industry average and below our own
target.

**Maintain 100% Uptime Guarantee**

_Unable to Provide Service:_ A catastrophic failure or
equipment malfunction at a NEXTDC data centre could
result in the Company not being able to provide power
and cooling to support our customers’ equipment, thus
breaching our service level agreements and incurring
contractual liabilities. To address this risk, all of
NEXTDC’s data centres are designed and built with
sufficient redundancy in place (including redundant
paths for power and cooling) to enable components to
go offline and be repaired or maintained without
affecting our customers’ IT equipment. A sound
assurance and maintenance program, periodic recovery
testings, in-house design expertise and third-party peer
review and certification are among the many controls in
place to manage the risks of not being able to meet our
100% uptime guarantee.

**Building New Sites/Data Centres**

_Development: NEXTDC is involved in the development_
of data centres in Australia and overseas and also the
expansion of existing facilities and new Edge and
remote sites. Generally, development projects have a
number of risks including (i) the risk that suitable sites
or required planning consents and regulatory
approvals, including approvals from the local water
authority and the local power distribution grid operator,
are not obtained or, if obtained, are received later than
expected, or are adverse to NEXTDC’s interests, or
are not properly adhered to; (ii) the escalation of
development costs (including the costs of construction
and fit out and any associated delays) beyond those
originally expected; (iii) unforeseen project delays or
supply chain issues, or delays in delivery beyond the
control of NEXTDC including for example the timely
supply of critical data centre infrastructure or
components related to the site’s development or a data
centre build or fit out and commissioning programs; and
(iv) non-performance/breach of contract by a contractor
or sub-contractor in relation to any of the above.
Increases in supply or falls in demand could influence
the acquisition of sites, the timing and value of sales and
carrying value of projects.
To fundamentally manage these risks, NEXTDC has
implemented management processes designed to drive
consistency in the planning, design, engineering,
procurement and project management for each site.



-  _Customer demand: Development of new and existing_
data centres is capital intensive and sometimes
undertaken without pre-sales commitment from
customers. There is a risk that there will not be enough
customer demand to achieve a sufficient return on
investment. NEXTDC’s business model to become the
largest independent, carrier neutral channel ecosystem
in the Asia-Pacific region aims to manage this risk
by developing sites mindful of market demand and
customer needs with the aim of offering a service and
connectivity compelling to our customers. NEXTDC’s
next-generation of data centres are particularly
focussed on more scalable fit-outs. This will allow us
to stay in step with demand whilst lowering our initial
capital outlay as well as being able to more closely align
incremental capital investment with incremental
customer contracts. We are also aiming to increase
sales by providing complementary products and
services.

**Ensuring Financial Health of the Company**

-  _Funding:_ NEXTDC’s business is capital intensive in
nature and our continued growth relies on the
acquisition and development of new and existing data
centres, along with investment in new technologies.
Failure to obtain sufficient capital on favourable terms
may hinder NEXTDC’s ability to expand and pursue
growth opportunities, which may reduce
competitiveness and have an adverse effect on financial
performance. To address this risk, NEXTDC has sought
to obtain funding from various sources in order to not
become over-reliant on any one form of funding as well
as to maintain adequate liquidity to be able to cope with
surges in customer demand as well as to take
advantage of any attractive investment opportunities.

**Security of Data and Information**

-  _Physical Security Breach:_ Physical security is the
foundation of data centre security and security risk
management is an integral part of NEXTDC’s purpose,
governance and operations. A breach could seriously
interfere with NEXTDC’s or its customers operations,
damaging their and our reputation. NEXTDC’s security
risk management program is designed to safeguard our
assets, people, property and information as well as
customer equipment, security and operational
environments. NEXTDC customers rely on our
physical security to prevent unauthorised access to
the space where their equipment resides. NEXTDC
seeks to provide customers with the highest standards
of security. The protection of NEXTDC data centres is
enhanced using successive layers of physical security.
At each level, these limit access to only those with the
appropriate authorisation, be it access to the entrance,
common, storage or staging areas, private cages, data
hall environment or support infrastructure. NEXTDC’s
security and protection measures reflect ongoing
changes in the risk environment and protect the integrity
of customer information in our care.


-----

-  _Privacy & Data Security:_ NEXTDC collects a minimal
amount of Personally Identifiable Information (PII),
limited to activities such as account and contract
management, marketing and to permit entry into its
facilities. NEXTDC does not store, interact with or
manage any data stored on its customers’ equipment.
Customers are responsible for managing their own IT
equipment and data security. All PII is securely
managed in compliance with applicable data protection
laws and regulations covering all aspects of our
operations and information security practices based on
ISO 27001 controls. However, a breach, disclosing
information about NEXTDC operations could damage
its reputation and interfere with its operations. NEXTDC
is certified by the Australian Federal Government’s
Digital Transformation Agency (DTA) as a Certified
Strategic Enclave hosting provider of data centre
services. Certified Strategic status is the highest level of
certification attainable and recognition of our alignment
with the highest certification standards assuring
Federal, State and local government organisations on
security and data sovereignty issues.

-  _Cyber Risk: Cyber resilience is an important element of_
customer data security. NEXTDC’s Security
Operations Centre actively supports and responds to
cyber threats. Our Cybersecurity framework, based on
ISO 27001 enables us to manage cybersecurity-related
risk. We also perform third-party audits to benchmark
relevance and effectiveness.

**Revenue Generation and Customer Growth**

-  _Customer Management: NEXTDC is committed to_
building a culture that values our customers and
provides the best experience for them, from the first to
the last point of contact. This is central to all phases of
the customer lifecycle. Besides measuring ourselves
against key customer metrics, we continue to evolve our
customer resourcing models to ensure we deliver great
service and monitor the outcomes and feedback.

-  _Meeting Customer Requirements:_ Some of our
customers and channel partners are large, wellestablished businesses. Not delivering the appropriate
solution within the required timeframe to meet their
requirements could significantly impact our brand
reputation as well as the ability to win further
opportunities. To minimise this risk, NEXTDC engages
its in-house engineering and project management
teams to ensure customers are provided with the
optimal solution, delivered on time and on budget.
Each customer has an assigned Customer Success
Manager to provide support as they transition from
sales prospects to active users of our products.

-  _Innovating to stay competitive: Innovation is at the heart_
of everything we do. NEXTDC’s on-going strategic
initiatives include a focus on research and development
designed to foster innovation and excellence in data
centre development and operations. A large part of that
is our interactions with customers which are essential in
understanding which solutions and innovations can
drive value for customers, and demand in the relevant
industry sectors and to ensure that NEXTDC continues
to retain its competitive advantage.


Significant changes in the state of
affairs

Other than what has already been mentioned in this report,
there have been no further significant changes in the state
of affairs of the Group during FY23.

Matters subsequent to the end of the
financial period

No matters or circumstances have arisen since 30 June
2023 that have significantly affected the Group’s
operations, results or state of affairs, or may do so in future
years, except as disclosed below:

On 23 August 2023, NEXTDC Limited announced the
Company’s contracted utilisation has increased by
25MW (21%) to 145MW.

Likely developments and expected
results of operations

Likely developments in the operations of the Group that
were not finalised at the date of this report include the
continued fit out of data centre capacity in existing facilities
and the pursuit of further growth opportunities.

Dividends

In considering dividend policy the Board considers the
demand for capital to invest in growth, its level of retained
earnings and the availability of franked earnings.

Although the Company is expanding operating cashflow,
NEXTDC is some way from paying tax and consequently
from generating franking credits. The Company continues
to experience strong demand for its services and
consequently is continuing to make substantial capital
investment into the business. It is unlikely that NEXTDC will
pay any dividend in the next two years.

Dividends were neither paid nor declared during the year.


-----

Environmental regulation

NEXTDC is constantly monitoring and revising the best
way to manage our data centres to minimise the impact to
the environment. Environmental regulation relevant to
NEXTDC’s operations are set out below.
The FY23 Environmental, Social and Governance Report
(located at www.nextdc.com) provides further details on
how NEXTDC addresses matters of environmental and
social sustainability.

**Greenhouse gas and energy data reporting**
**requirements**

NEXTDC monitors its carbon emissions for reporting and
is registered under the National Greenhouse and Energy
Reporting Act (“NGER”). Additionally, corporate operations
are certified 100% carbon neutral under the Australian
Federal Government’s Climate Active program (previously
known as the National Carbon Offset Standard, or NCOS).
We have continued to achieve carbon neutrality by
offsetting emissions associated with our corporate
operations. NEXTDC’s NEXTneutral, a certified carbon
neutral colocation solution offered as an opt-in product to
our customers, allows our customers to voluntarily have
their carbon footprint off-set to be 100% carbon neutral on
the same basis as NEXTDC’s organisational 100% carbon
neutral accreditation.

All NEXTDC data centres are certified to ISO 14001,
Environmental Management System certification. An
exception to this is NEXTDC’s edge data centre in the
Sunshine Coast (SC1) and the newly established S3
Sydney and M3 Melbourne facilities that are already
operated in line with national standards. Our intention is to
complete this process within the next 12 months, where
this is applicable to the service we provide.

**on Climate related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)**
**implementation**

Refer to page 14 of the Annual Report for further details on
our alignment with the recommendations of TCFD.

Insurance of officers

During the period, NEXTDC Limited paid a premium of
$3,365,500 (FY22: $4,217,414) to insure the Directors
and Officers of the Group.

The liabilities insured include legal costs that may be
incurred in defending civil or criminal proceedings that
may be brought against individuals in their capacity as
officers of entities in the Group and any other liabilities or
amounts sought against them in connection with such
proceedings. This does not include liabilities that arise
from conduct involving a wilful breach of duty by the
officers or the improper use by the officers of their position
or of information to gain advantage for themselves or
someone else or to cause detriment to the Group. The
Directors & Officers Liability insurance also covers security
claims against the Company itself. It is not possible
to apportion the premium between amounts relating to
the insurance against legal costs to defend the officers
and those relating to other liabilities.


Proceedings on behalf of the Company

**1.** **MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIR OF THE REMUNERATION AND NOMINATION COMMITTEE**

NEXTDC’s Remuneration Report details how its executive remuneration outcomes are linked to both its corporate and individuals’
performance for the 2023 financial year. The report details our remuneration policy for FY23 and the alignment between executive
remuneration and shareholder outcomes.

In FY23, NEXTDC achieved a number of key performance milestones:


**Total revenue**

###### $362.4M

-  $71.3M (25%)

**Contracted utilisation**

###### 122.2MW

-  39.2MW (47%)


**Underlying EBITDA[1]**

###### $193.7M

-  $24.6M (15%)

**Debt Facility**

###### $2.9B


**Operating cashflow**

###### $126.5M

-  $9.3M (8%)

**Capital expenditure**

###### $690.4M


The Company’s remuneration policies remain under continuous review by the Remuneration and Nomination Committee (the
“Committee”) throughout the year with the aim of ensuring alignment with the Company’s strategic objectives and to ensure
retention of key talent. Noting that shareholder interests and community expectations are key elements of this process, the
Committee is mindful that the Company is a high-performance business focussed on its growth objectives and its broader
environmental and social responsibilities.

The Committee is also aware of broader trends in the executive space, and mindful of competitors and comparator groups in
Australian and international markets, and unlisted competitors.

This year’s Senior Executive remuneration program, which was confirmed by the Committee, set performance targets with
reference to key project milestones and shareholder expectations. Financial performance, key business deliverables and
broader behavioural and health and safety metrics were all incorporated into the program. The Committee is also focussed on
operational efficiencies and driving environmental outcomes as part of its strategic focus.

The Committee continues to reflect on the balance of its disclosures of operational information in the context of executive
performance. It believes there is a clear benefit in providing as much transparency as possible but will, at times, be circumspect
about some of the details if it feels this could erode the Company’s competitive or strategic advantage. For now, the Committee
believes an appropriate balance has been struck, and it will continue to take shareholder feedback on these matters and make
refinements so as to maintain an appropriate balance between these two considerations.

In terms of the overall remuneration structure for FY23 the Committee is of the view that its components, as described in this
Remuneration Report, are strongly aligned with shareholder value.


-----

**Looking forward – Senior Executive remuneration in FY24**

To ensure the remuneration framework remains fit-for-purpose for the next phase of the Company’s strategy and growth, the
Committee undertook a review of the existing Senior Executive remuneration framework in FY23, with input from external
advisors as well as recent remuneration benchmarking at regional management levels in Asia and into privately owned
companies in Australia. The review considered several factors, including prevailing economic conditions, current and future
strategic priorities, retention of key executive talent and the appropriateness of the current framework in meeting industry
opportunities and risks.

Following the review, the Board has determined to make the following remuneration changes for FY24:

-  A 15% increase in fixed remuneration for Senior Executives, including the CEO, effective 1 July 2023. This reflects
their demonstrated contribution towards the Company’s global strategic growth, including a 33% increase in market
capitalisation since the end of FY22 (44% from the start of FY21), benchmarking against the regional management
levels in Asia as well as privately owned peers in Australia, and a 14% increase in the Australian Consumer Price
Index since their previous increase in fixed remuneration in January 2021; and

-  Modifications to the existing long-term incentive (LTI) plan to further generate Senior Executive share ownership and
alignment with long-term shareholder interests, whilst ensuring that we continue to motivate and retain high-performing
and innovative executive talent in a competitive market. With several key regional expansion projects underway and
the high demand for experienced Senior Executives in our industry, this alignment is critical to our ongoing success
and ability to drive long-term shareholder value.

Further details on the fixed remuneration increase can be found below, with full details of the FY24 LTI plan to be disclosed in
the Notice of 2023 AGM and FY24 Remuneration Report.

The Committee and I are looking forward to further engaging with our shareholders and will be listening carefully to your
comments and observations concerning our remuneration policies and practices.

**3.** **OVERVIEW OF REMUNERATION GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK**

Our mission is to be the leading customer-centric data centre services company, delivering solutions that power, secure and
connect enterprise. NEXTDC’s remuneration policy is designed to incentivise and reward Senior Executives for achieving its
overarching objectives of building market-leading sales performance, hosting the country’s largest independent ecosystem of
carriers, cloud and IT service providers and enabling customers to source and connect with suppliers and partners in an integrated
hybrid cloud environment.

Our remuneration framework, applicable to the 2023 financial year is outlined and summarised below.

**3.1 Senior Executive Remuneration (SER) Policy**

The Senior Executive Remuneration Policy applies to Senior Executives who are defined as:

-  The Chief Executive Officer who is accountable to the Board for the Company’s performance and long-term planning;

-  Heads of Business Units, or those with key functional roles, or essential expertise, that report directly to the Chief Executive
Officer;

-  Other executive roles classified as KMP under the Corporations Act; and

-  Other roles or individuals nominated by the Board from time to time.

**OTHER STAKEHOLDERS** relation to Executive remuneration matters. These advisors:

- Review and provide recommendations on the appropriateness of Senior Executive remuneration

- Provide independent information to assist with remuneration decisions
Advice or recommendations provided are used to assist the Board. Remuneration decisions are undertaken
through the Board and Remuneration and Nomination Committee process.

Benchmarking data was provided by Morrow Sodali in FY22 and FY23 to review Senior Executive and NonExecutive remuneration. No remuneration recommendation as defined in Section 9B of the Corporations
Act 2001 was made. The Board is satisfied that any advice provided by Morrow Sodali was made free from
undue influence from any of the KMP.


The SER policy details how executive remuneration is structured, benchmarked and adjusted in response to changes in the
circumstances of the Company. NEXTDC’s Senior Executives Total Remuneration Package (TRP) includes the following
components:

FIGURE 2: TOTAL FY23 REMUNERATION (IF MAXIMUM INCENTIVE PAYMENTS ARE RECEIVED)


-----

**3.2 Senior Executive Remuneration Benchmarks**
When considering executive remuneration, the Committee frequently has reference to domestic and international industry
benchmarks relevant to its market sector, growth and value as well as unlisted competitors, general market conditions and the
individual’s role and performance. Factors specific to the data centre industry are also evaluated to ensure a high degree of
alignment with strategic goals and in order to foster high retention rates in the leadership team and in the business more
broadly. The Committee continues to be mindful of strong and ongoing competitive pressures for top talent in the sector both
internationally and locally. The Committee considerations include the following fundamentals in setting executive remuneration
packages:

-  The individual’s skillsets and contribution to long term revenue and EBITDA growth;

-  Their contribution to the delivery of key strategic goals and milestones;

-  Their contribution to key measures of operational excellence including those relating to running of the business, the
Company’s strategic initiatives, safety and cultural values;

-  Their relevant industry knowledge, experience and connections;

-  Domestic and international comparators with whom NEXTDC must compete for talent; and

-  Prevailing economic conditions.

As outlined in the Chairman’s comments, during FY23, the Committee evaluated Senior Executives’ fixed remuneration and
TRP, in line with movements in the Australian Consumer Price Index, as well as the trajectory of the Company's growth,
strategic objectives and priorities, scarcity of talent, and changes in a roles’ complexity and NEXTDC’s geographical spread.
Following this review, the Board approved a 15% increase in fixed remuneration for Senior Executives (including the CEO) for
FY24, taking into account their demonstrated contribution towards the Company’s growth, reflected by a 33% increase in the
Company’s market capitalisation since the end of FY22 (44% since the start of FY21). The review also considered appropriate
benchmarking against regional management levels in Asia as well as privately owned peers in Australia (recognising that
NEXTDC competes for Senior Executive talent with both listed and unlisted companies).

The Committee’s view is that the nature of the business and its local and international customer base, relationships and
competitors are such that its TRP levels should continue to be assessed against both domestic and international remuneration
benchmarks.

**3.3 Senior Executive Remuneration Mix**

The Senior Executive remuneration mix refers to the proportion of remuneration that executives can receive as fixed versus
any variable “at risk” remuneration component. Assuming performance is at a level at which incentives pay out in full,
approximately 71% of the TRP remuneration received is performance related.

The graph below sets out the remuneration mix if maximum incentive payments are received for the CEO and other Senior
Executive KMP for FY23.

FIGURE 3: FY23 POTENTIAL REMUNERATION MIX

FIXED (29%) AT RISK (71%)

Fixed Remuneration (29%) STI (14%) Deferred STI (14%) LTI – 3 Year (21.5%) LTI – 4 Year (21.5%)


-----

**3.4 Senior Executive Remuneration and Performance**

The Board has determined that significant remuneration opportunities should continue to be contingent on realising the
Company’s ongoing financial and operational objectives. The Committee is disclosing further detail in relation to how incentive
outcomes were determined in FY23 to ensure shareholders gain an appropriate level of insight into the key strategic and project
milestones set for Senior Executives remuneration. The Committee is aiming to set these to ensure NEXTDC’s executive
continue to be focussed on developing and growing its first-class data centre business, customer success and expanding its
national and international network of data centres. These remain the key drivers for shareholder value creation and continue to
be the cornerstones of our incentive program.

Below see Senior Executive remuneration and performance assessed relative to NEXTDC’s performance over the past five
years:

opportunities, as well as investment in associates.


-----

**3.5 Variable remuneration – Short Term Incentive (STI) Plan**

The Committee recognises that NEXTDC is a capital-intensive business that requires significant investment for infrastructure
to be built prior to generating income from customer contracts. With NEXTDC operating in a high-growth industry, the Company
needs to continue to expand its infrastructure investment to keep pace with customer demand. It is on this basis that the Board
and Committee places emphasis on revenue and underlying EBITDA generation as well as delivery of projects and maintaining
strong operational performance when incentivising Senior Executives.

The composition of performance metrics comprising the FY23 STI program are as follows:

FIGURE 4: FY23 STI PERFORMANCE METRICS

**10%** Underlying EBITDA

**15%**

Total Revenue

**40%**

Major Project
Delivery

Operations

**35%**


**FINANCIAL YEAR 2023 STI PLAN**

The purpose of the STI Plan is to provide an incentive for Senior Executives to achieve against the Company’s strategic
objectives by delivering or exceeding on annual business plan requirements to ensure sustainable superior returns for
shareholders. Key terms of the FY23 STI Plan are detailed below.



|Feature|Description|Col3|Col4|
|---|---|---|---|
|Opportunity|Subject to the achievement of the Gateway, participants may achieve up to a stretch (maximum) award of 100% of their Base Salary Package.|||
|Gateway|In order to qualify for any award under the FY23 STI incentive program, underlying EBITDA achieved in FY23 must be at least 95% of the midpoint value of the initial guidance range given for underlying EBITDA performance in that year. In FY23 that gateway was set at $184.3m. A further performance gate for this year was fulfilling the Company’s uptime obligations to its customers. No STI is to be awarded to any individual acting in breach of the Company’s code of conduct.|||
|Measurement period|The Company’s financial year i.e., from 1 July 2022 to 30 June 2023.|||
|Performance metrics|In FY23 the below Company Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were selected as being the most relevant drivers for improving financial performance and growth in shareholder value.|||
||Metric|Weighting|Reason for selection|
||Underlying EBITDA1|Up to 40%|Indicates the Company’s underlying profitability, a measure best suited to its stage of development: • 50% achieved at bottom end of initial guidance range ($190m) • 100% achieved at top end of initial guidance range ($198m) • A linear progression to be applied between the limits.|
||Total Revenue|Up to 35%|Indicates the Company’s level of incremental growth in new business for the period, an essential criterion in assessing NEXTDC’s financial and operational performance: • 50% achieved at bottom end of initial guidance range ($340m) • 100% achieved at top end of initial guidance range ($355m) • A linear progression to be applied between the limits.|


-----

|Feature|Description|Col3|Col4|
|---|---|---|---|
||Major Project Delivery|Up to 15%|This component is for agreed major projects and clear, definable outcomes that drive future growth in capabilities, revenue, and earnings. Projects are mostly identified at or prior to the beginning of the financial year but may also be added as the financial year progresses. Projects may complete within the year or flow into the following year. In applying measures against performance, the time and cost will be that approved in the original approved project submission. These may be modified as to scope, time and costs in subsequent approved Board submissions. In calculating the award, weighting was to be given to each of the major projects as indicated in Figure 5 below.|
||Operations|Up to 10%|This component is for key operational metrics that affect service level standards expressed in uptime performance, data centre energy efficiency as well as measures relating to the health and safety of our employees and visitors. In calculating the award, weighing was given to each performance component as indicated in Figure 6 below.|
|Delivery of STI|Payments will be in cash unless otherwise determined by the Board and will normally be paid in September following the Measurement Period subject to the deferral of 50% of the final STI payment, which may be delivered in cash or by grant of rights to acquire fully paid ordinary shares. Deferring 50% of the awarded STI for a period of 12 months is intended to promote sustainability of annual performance over the medium term, acts as a retention mechanism and facilitates the exercise of malus provisions should the Board determine to exercise its discretion.|||
|Board discretion|If the Company’s overall performance during the Measurement Period is substantially lower than expectations and has resulted in a significant loss to shareholders’ value, the Board may abandon the STI Plan for the Measurement Period or adjust STI pay outs.|||
|Forfeiture and termination|In the event of cessation of employment due to dismissal for cause, all unvested deferred STI’s are forfeited. In the event of cessation of employment due to resignation, all unvested deferred STI’s are forfeited unless otherwise determined by the Board. In the event of cessation of employment due to death, total and permanent disability or redundancy, unvested deferred STI’s will continue on-foot and be subject to the original terms as though employment had not ceased, unless the Board determines otherwise. In any other circumstances the Board has discretion to determine how the unvested deferred STI’s will be treated upon cessation of employment with the Company.|||
|Malus/ Clawback Provisions|The Board retains the ability to reduce or apply malus/clawback to awards where the participant has acted fraudulently or dishonestly or is in material breach of their obligations to the Company; where the Company becomes aware of material misstatements or omissions in the financial statements of the Company; where the Company is required by or entitled under law or Company policy to reclaim remuneration; or where any circumstances occur that the Board determines to have resulted in an unfair benefit to the recipient.|||

**3.6 Variable remuneration – Long Term Incentive (LTI) Plan**

**FINANCIAL YEAR 2023 LTI PLAN**

The aim of the LTI Plan is to provide an incentive for Senior Executives to help achieve the Company’s strategic objectives
and to deliver performance that is sustainable and aligned with shareholder interests. It also acts as a retention mechanism
to maintain a stable team of high performing executives. The current LTI Plan is the NEXTDC Limited Equity Incentive Plan
(EIP).

The Committee recognises that continual review is required to ensure the program remains in step with the Company’s rapid
growth, and in line with trends, both of ASX market peers and international competitors.

**Feature** **Description**

|Opportunity/ Allocation|Maximum LTI value was set at 150% of Base Salary Packages. The LTI grant of Performance Rights is calculated by applying the following formula: Number of Performance Rights = Base Package x Maximum LTI% ÷ Right Value NB: The Right Value is the volume weighted average share price of Shares over the 10 trading days following the release of the Company’s FY22 results. The “Maximum LTI %” recognises that the stretch level of Rights will be granted when stretch performance is achieved.|

|Measurement period|The measurement period for the LTI award will now be extended to include tranches which vest after the 3rd and 4th years. For FY23, the LTI award comprises: • Tranche 1 (50% of the total LTI award), which will be tested after three years and be eligible to vest at that time; and • Tranche 2 (50% of the total LTI award), which will be tested after four years and be eligible to vest at that time. In all cases performance is measured over a period commencing from the end of the day of the release of the Company’s full year results (for this award it is the release of the FY22 results) to the end of the day of the release of its results for the relevant year (in this case, it is FY25 and FY26). No component will be subject to re-testing.||
|Performance conditions|Vesting of each tranche of the LTI award is subject to two performance conditions: 1. Gateway Hurdle Vesting of the Performance Rights is subject to an initial gateway hurdle of NEXTDC achieving positive total shareholder return (TSR) over the relevant measurement period for that tranche. If the gateway hurdle is not met, the rights under the EIP automatically lapse even if the TSR Hurdle (described below) is achieved. 2. TSR Hurdle In addition to the Gateway Hurdle, vesting under the EIP is subject to a relative TSR performance condition. The TSR Hurdle is determined by ranking NEXTDC’s TSR over the measurement period for the relevant tranche, relative to the TSR of companies in the ASX 100 Accumulation Index (Index). Vesting of the EIP rights will be determined by reference to the following vesting schedule:||
||NEXTDC’s TSR over the Measurement Period|Percentage of Rights that vest|
||Less than TSR of Index|Nil|
||At TSR of Index|25%|
||Between TSR of Index and TSR of Index + 5%|Pro rata vesting from 25% to 100% on a straight-line basis|
||TSR of Index + 5% or greater|100%|
||The scale requires that the Company deliver a TSR to shareholders that is at least as good as the overall market (as indicated by the TSR of the Index over the measurement period) before any vesting may occur. Full vesting does not become available until the TSR of the Company reaches the TSR of the Index over the measurement period plus 5% p.a. This would, in the view of the Board, represent an outstanding outcome for shareholders. The Committee has again reviewed whether the introduction of a second LTI performance measure is appropriate. For now, it remains their and the Board’s view that an additional measure is not appropriate at NEXTDC’s current stage of development. The Committee regards the continued application of a relative TSR performance measure to be the most effective method for aligning long-term executive performance with shareholder wealth outcomes and will review the appropriateness of the single measure LTI program on an annual basis.||


**Reason for selection** TSR was selected as it recognises the total returns (share price movement and dividends
assuming they are reinvested into Company shares) that accrue to shareholders over the
Measurement Period. This measure creates the most direct alignment between shareholder return
and rewards realised by Senior Executives. The measurement period for assessing TSR
performance is aligned with the release of results to ensure that the share price upon which TSR
is determined at the start and end of the measurement period reflects an informed market.

Market adjusted TSR was selected to ensure that participants do not receive windfall gains from
broad market movements unrelated to the performance of the Senior Executives.

The positive TSR gate ensures that Senior Executives cannot benefit from the LTI Plan when
shareholders have lost value over the Measurement Period. Vesting commences upon NEXTDC’s
TSR matching the Index TSR, with full vesting occurring once NEXTDC’s TSR exceeds the Index
TSR by 5% compound annual growth over the measurement period. This hurdle has been
determined with regard for the historic performance of the ASX 100 Accumulation Index whereby
5% compound annual growth or greater represents upper quartile performance.
This would, in the Board’s view, represent an outstanding outcome for the Company.

|Feature|Description|
|---|---|
|Exercise of vested Incentive Rights|Upon vesting the Board will determine the extent to which their value will be delivered in Shares and/or cash. The Board will also determine whether Shares will be issued or acquired for participants via the Employee Share Trust (EST) and if the EST is used, whether new issues or on-market purchases of Shares will be undertaken by the trustee of the EST. No amount is payable by participants to exercise vested Incentive Rights.|
|Forfeiture and termination|In the event of cessation of employment due to dismissal for cause, all unvested Incentive Rights are forfeited. In the event of cessation of employment due to resignation, all unvested Incentive Rights are forfeited unless otherwise determined by the Board. In the event of cessation of employment due to death, total and permanent disability or redundancy, unvested performance rights will continue on-foot and be subject to the original terms as though employment had not ceased, unless the Board determines otherwise. In any other circumstances the Board has discretion to determine how the unvested Performance Rights will be treated upon cessation of employment with the Company.|
|Board discretion|The Board retains discretion to modify vesting outcomes. Incentive Rights that do not vest will lapse. Board discretion to vary vesting will generally only be applied when the vesting that would otherwise apply is considered by the Board to be inappropriate, and when it would not align with shareholder returns.|
|Change of Control|In circumstances where there is a likely change in the control of NEXTDC, the Board has discretion to determine the level of vesting (if any) having regard to the portion of the measurement period elapsed, performance to date against performance conditions and any other factors it considers appropriate. If an actual change in the control of the Company occurs before the Board can exercise this discretion, unless the Board determines otherwise, unvested Performance Rights will vest and become exercisable in proportion to the Company's performance against the TSR Hurdle up to the date of the change of control.|
|Malus/Claw back Provisions|The Board retains the ability to reduce or apply malus/clawback to awards where the participant has acted fraudulently or dishonestly or is in material breach of their obligations to the Company; or where the Company becomes aware of material misstatements or omissions in the financial statements of the Company; or any circumstances occur that the Board determines to have resulted in an unfair benefit to the recipient.|
|Hedging|The Company prohibits the hedging of Incentive Rights and Restricted Shares by Participants.|


**3.7 Risk Management and Clawback Provisions**

A sound risk management culture is important to NEXTDC. The Company’s STI and LTI Plans have been designed to
protect the Company from the risk of unintended or unjustified pay outcomes by allowing risk factors to be taken into
account over long periods and by way of a variety of measures that are considered key to the Company’s success. For
example:

-  Basing the STI on a number of performance measures, including initial gateway hurdles before any STI is able to be
paid (subject also to malus/clawback provisions)

-  Deferring a component (50%) of STI to ensure alignment with shareholder value and compliance with NEXTDC’s codes of
conduct and corporate governance

-  Distributing remuneration components across both long and short-term performance-based mechanisms to
encourage prudent risk taking in line with the overall objectives of the Company.

While formal shareholding requirements are not imposed for Senior Executives, the CEO has a material holding in
NEXTDC, holding shares and vested performance rights valued at approximately 12 times base salary at 30 June 2023.

Board discretion is applied to the vesting of all STIs and LTIs to ensure any proposed awards are aligned with shareholder
returns. As noted, the Board also retains the ability to reduce or clawback awards in the event of serious misconduct or a
material misstatement in the Company’s financial statements.

**4.** **STI AND LTI PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES FOR FY23**

**4.1 STI Vesting Outcomes**

The Executives performance against the FY23 STI performance measures – as previously described in section 3.5 above are
as follows. The Committee continues to be of the view that they were highly relevant to the Company’s financial performance
and to growing shareholder value. The individual components contributed to the overall composition of the STI award as follows:

Upon review of the above performance criteria set for the FY23 STI Program, the Committee has determined that 88% of the
FY23 STI opportunity be awarded to the participants. The FY23 STI outcome was determined by the Committee and approved
by the Board. This outcome strictly reflects the performance against the performance criteria set out for this year’s program.
There has been no further discretion applied to these outcomes.

The individual components of this assessment were as follows:

**4.2 LTI Vesting Outcomes**

The measurement period for the FY20 LTI was between 29 August 2019 and 29 August 2022. The vesting condition attached
to the FY20 LTI was based on NEXTDC’s TSR over the measurement period, against the relative performance of the S&P /
ASX 200 Accumulation Index (AXJOA), with vesting percentages to be determined by the following scale, as outlined in the 30
June 2020 Annual Report:

|NEXTDC’s TSR over the Measurement Period|Percentage of Rights that Vest|
|---|---|
|Less than TSR of Index|Nil|
|At TSR of Index|25%|
|Between TSR of Index and TSR of Index + 5%|Pro rata vesting from 25% to 100% on a straight-line basis|
|TSR of Index + 5% or greater|100%|



NEXTDC’s performance against the vesting conditions is summarised below:

Market TSR 5.9%

TSR required to achieve stretch hurdle 10.9%

TSR achieved 18.9%


Based on the above assessment, the stretch target was achieved, and the Board determined that 100% of the LTI granted in
FY20 vested, with rights converting to shares following the release of the FY22 Annual Report.

The measurement period for the FY21 LTI is for approximately a three-year period, beginning from the end of trade on the day
of release of the FY20 results, and ending upon the end of the day of release of the annual results for FY23. The vesting
condition attached to the FY21 LTI is based on NEXTDC’s TSR over the measurement period, against the relative performance
of the S&P / ASX 200 Accumulation Index (Index).

Given vesting is not able to be determined until the end of day of release of the FY23 annual results, the Board will determine
vesting following the release of the FY23 Annual Report.

**5.** **EMPLOYMENT TERMS FOR DIRECTORS AND SENIOR EXECUTIVES**

**5.1 Non-Executive Directors**

Once appointed all Non-Executive Directors enter into a service agreement with the Company in the form of a letter of
appointment. The letter summarises the Board policies and terms, including compensation relevant to the office of the Director.

All current Non-Executive Directors carry an initial contract duration of three years (subject to election and re-election by
shareholders). The employment contracts for the Non-Executive Directors do not carry notice period provisions, nor do they
provide for any termination benefits.

All Directors must retire from office at the third annual general meeting after the Director was last elected and will then be
eligible for re-election. Upon cessation of a Director’s appointment, the Director will be paid his or her Director’s fees on a prorata basis, to the extent that they are unpaid.

The Non-Executive Director Remuneration Policy applies to Non-Executive Directors of the Company in their capacity as
Directors and as members of committees, and may be summarised as follows:

-  Remuneration comprises:

– Board fees
– Committee fees
– Superannuation
– Other benefits
– Securities (if appropriate at the time).

-  Remuneration is managed within the aggregate fee limit (AFL) or fee pool of $1,600,000 which was approved by
shareholders at the FY20 AGM in November 2020.

-  The Non-Executive Director Remuneration Policy contains guidelines on when the Board should seek adjustment to the


-----

-  Remuneration should be reviewed annually.

-  Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to termination benefits.

-  The level of Board Fees (being the fees paid for membership of the Board, inclusive of superannuation and exclusive of
committee fees) will be set with reference to the median of comparable ASX listed companies.

-  Committee fees may be used to recognise additional contributions to the work of the Board by members of committees, but
in a manner that, when combined with Board Fees, will not exceed the 75[th] percentile of comparable ASX listed companies.

-  The Company does not currently provide securities as part of Non-Executive Director remuneration.

In accordance with the Non-Executive Director Remuneration Policy, during FY23 the Remuneration and Nomination
Committee conducted an annual review of Non-Executive Director remuneration. The review was informed by an independent
benchmarking exercise with reference to ASX-listed companies of a similar size as well as recent recruitment benchmarking at
regional management levels in Asia and into privately owned companies in Australia. The benchmarking exercise compared
NXT to companies that are directly comparable in terms of market capitalisation, with 10 larger and 10 smaller than NXT within
the ASX100 index only. In conjunction with the benchmarking exercise, the review also considered other factors such as
surrounding market conditions and sentiment, the trajectory of the Company’s growth, strategic objectives, and the
geographical spread of the Company.

As a result of the review, it was determined that an increase in Non-Executive Director remuneration was warranted, effective
from October 2022.

The rates of fees including superannuation contributions in respect of the 2023 financial year are as follows:

TABLE 3: NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FEE SCHEDULE

**From July 2022** **From October 2022**

Board Chair $330,000 per annum $430,000 per annum

Non-Executive Director $152,000 per annum $170,000 per annum

Audit and Risk Management Committee Chair $35,000 per annum $40,000 per annum

Remuneration and Nomination Committee Chair $35,000 per annum $40,000 per annum

Investment Committee Chair $35,000 per annum $40,000 per annum

Committee Member $15,000 per annum $17,000 per annum

**Recommended Non-Executive Director Shareholding**

Non-Executive Directors are encouraged to accumulate shares on their own behalf, over a three-year period, of equivalent
value to their average annual Directors’ fees.

**5.2 Senior Executives**

Remuneration and other terms of employment for the Chief Executive Officer and other key management personnel are also
formalised in service agreements.

The CEO’s base salary package has remained consistent at $1.32 million since FY19 noting that effective 1 July 2022 his
salary package saw a minor increase of $1,724 as a result of the Company’s commitment to contribute a 0.5% increase in
Super Guarantee Contribution (SGC). Since his appointment to the role in 2012, the CEO has overseen the Company’s
expansion. Over the last four years, NEXTDC has achieved:

NEXTDC is unique among ASX-listed companies due to its high capital-intensity and growth prospects requiring further capital
to be invested ahead of demonstrable revenues and profits. Most comparable peers are US-based, as is the more comparable
executive talent. The Board considered the Company’s long-term strategy and potential and determined that the CEO’s
remuneration remains appropriate in context of the skills and experience necessary to lead NEXTDC.

|2022|$13.41|
|2023|$10.09|



Deferred rights under the Senior Executive STI Plan are granted following release of the annual results. The shares vest one
year from the grant date. On vesting, each right automatically converts into one ordinary share. Senior Executives do not
receive any dividends and are not entitled to vote in relation to the rights during the vesting period. If a Senior Executive ceases
employment before the rights vest, they have six months from the cessation of employment or the vesting date, whichever is
later, to exercise their deferred rights. Any rights not exercised in this period will automatically lapse.

The fair value of the rights is determined based on the volume weighted average trading price of the Company’s shares over
the 10 trading days following release of the Company’s annual results.

**6.5 Remuneration Received (Non-statutory)**

**Remuneration received in FY23**

The amounts disclosed below as Senior Executive remuneration for FY23 reflect the actual benefits received by each Senior
Executive during the reporting period. The remuneration values disclosed have been determined as follows:

_Fixed remuneration_
Fixed remuneration includes base salaries received, paid leave, payments made to superannuation funds, and the taxable
value of non-monetary benefits received, and excludes any accruals of annual or long service leave.

_Short-term incentives_
Awarded STI represents bonuses that were awarded to each Senior Executive in relation to FY23 performance, 50% of
which will be paid in FY24. 50% of the STI bonuses awarded are deferred for 12 months, with employees being able to elect
whether the award will be delivered in cash or equity. Deferred STI represents the remaining 50% of the FY23 STI that is
expected to vest in FY24.

_Long term incentives_
The value of vested rights was determined based on the intrinsic value of the rights at the date of vesting, being the difference
between the share price on that date, and the exercise price payable by the Senior Executive. The performance rights that
vested in FY23 were granted in 2020.

**Total** **2,839,904** **1,243,591** **1,243,591** **4,192,617** **9,519,703**

The amounts disclosed above are not the same as the remuneration expensed in relation to each KMP in accordance with
accounting standards. The Directors believe that the remuneration received is more relevant to users for the following reasons:

-  The statutory remuneration expensed is based on historic cost and does not reflect the value of the equity instruments
when they are actually received by the Senior Executives

-  The statutory remuneration shows benefits before they are actually received by the Senior Executives

-  Where rights do not vest because a market-based performance condition is not satisfied (e.g. TSR), the Company must
still recognise the full amount of expenses even though the Senior Executives will never receive any benefits.

-  Share based payment awards are treated differently under the accounting standards depending on whether the
performance conditions are market conditions (no reversal of expense) or non-market conditions (reversal of expense
when shares fail to vest), even though the benefit received by the Senior Executives is the same (nil where equity
instruments fail to vest).

The information in this section has been audited together with the rest of the remuneration report.

Audit and non-audit services

Details of the amounts paid or payable to the auditor (PricewaterhouseCoopers Australia) for audit and non-audit services during
the year are disclosed in Note 24 Remuneration of auditors.

The Company may decide to employ the auditor on assignments additional to their statutory audit duties where the auditor’s
expertise and experience with the Company and/or the group are important.

The board of directors, in accordance with advice provided by the Audit and Risk Management Committee, is satisfied that the
provision of the non-audit services is compatible with the general standard of independence for auditors imposed by the
Corporations Act 2001. The directors are satisfied that the provision of non-audit services by the auditor did not compromise the
auditor independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 for the following reasons:

-  all non-audit services have been reviewed by the Audit and Risk Management Committee to ensure they do not
impact the impartiality and objectivity of the auditor, and

-  none of the services undermine the general principles relating to auditor independence as set out in APES 110 Code
of Ethics for Professional Accountants.

Auditor’s independence declaration

A copy of the auditor’s independence declaration as required under section 307C of the Corporations Act 2001 is set out
on page 60.

Auditor

PricewaterhouseCoopers continues in office in accordance with section 327 of the Corporations Act 2001. This report

Corporate Governance Statement

NEXTDC has established a strong governance framework that defines the roles and
responsibilities of NEXTDC’s Board, management team, employees and suppliers.

NEXTDC continues to be committed to the highest levels of integrity and ethical standards in all its business
practices, recognising that effective and transparent corporate governance is critical to its success. The framework
continues to evolve as we seek continual improvements in the way we conduct the business.

The Corporate Governance Statement has been approved by the Board and fully supports the intent of the Australian
Securities Exchange (“ASX”) Corporate Governance Council’s new 4th edition of Corporate Governance Principles and
Recommendations (“4th Edition Governance Principles”). NEXTDC meets all the requirements of 4th Edition
Governance Principles.

This Statement describes NEXTDC’s key governance practices and articulates how decision‑making is guided to meet
stakeholder expectations of sound corporate governance, acknowledging the Company’s specific and broader
responsibilities to its shareholders, customers, suppliers, employees, and the communities in which it operates.

At NEXTDC, corporate governance is an essential element of how we operate. It refers to the overarching monitoring
and reporting of the Company’s business operations and is the combination of processes implemented and monitored
by the Board and the Executive team to direct, manage and scrutinise NEXTDC’s activities.

We aim to maintain and build on our relationships with our shareholders, customers, suppliers, team members, and
the broader community to achieve our vision of becoming Australia’s most trusted data centre provider. We are
focused on operating in a socially responsible and ethical manner, and meeting the highest standards of integrity and
cultural sensitivity whilst adhering to clear corporate governance standards.

NEXTDC’s values are anchored in its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) policies, which are the guiding principles in
our Corporate Governance Program. This includes:

-  a solid risk management framework, complete with internal controls

-  procedures as well as operational processes such as, for example, our policies relating to team members’ conduct,
training and operational standards and our dealings with shareholders and the ASX

-  a regular reporting cadence to the Board and CXO team to enable them to manage, monitor and report on
NEXTDC’s performance and its risk management; and

-  regular internal audits based on best practice standards to independently verify the effectiveness of corporate
governance, risks management and internal control processes to identify and manage operational gaps.

NEXTDC’s Corporate Governance Framework continues to evolve
as we continue to foster trust, attract investors, inspire employee
confidence and maintain our reputation and value in the market.
Further details on how NEXTDC’s Corporate Governance aligns with
the 4th Edition Governance Principles can be found in the Company’s
FY23 Corporate Governance Statement and Appendix 4G available at

**(a) Principles of consolidation and equity accounting**

_(i)_ _Associates_
Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control or joint control. This is
generally the case where the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates
are accounted for using the equity method of accounting (see (ii) below), after initially being recognised at cost.

_(ii) Equity method_
Under the equity method of accounting, the investments are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to
recognise the Group's share of the post-acquisition profits or losses of the investee in profit or loss, and the
Group's share of movements in other comprehensive income of the investee in other comprehensive income.
Dividends received or receivable from associates and joint ventures are recognised as a reduction in the carrying
amount of the investment.

Where the Group's share of losses in an equity-accounted investment equals or exceeds its interest in the entity,
including any other unsecured long-term receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has
incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the other entity.

**(a) Principles of consolidation and equity accounting (continued)**

_(ii) Equity method (continued)_
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the
extent of the Group's interest in these entities. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction
provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of equity-accounted investees
have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

The carrying amount of equity-accounted investments is tested for impairment in accordance with the policy
described in note 27(g).

**Business performance**

**2** **Segment performance**

**(a) Description of segments**

Management considers the business from a geographic perspective and has identified five reportable segments,
being each geography where the Group operates data centre facilities and the last capturing financial information
from operations that do not naturally fit into any particular geography. As these segments do not exist as a
separate legal entity, information such as income tax expense and segment liabilities are not prepared and
provided to management for review and therefore not presented.

During the year, management reassessed the basis for grouping its operating segments into reportable
segments. As a result of a change in the way chief operating decision makers review information, management
has determined that Queensland (Qld) and Western Australia (WA), along with South Australia and Northern
Territory, should be combined in to one reportable segment (Rest of Australia) effective 1 July 2022. The Other
segment also no longer includes any international operations, as these are now presented as a distinct
International segment. Comparative information has also been combined to reflect this change.

**(b) Segment information provided to management**

The segment information provided to management for the reportable segments is as follows:

**(b) Revenue recognition**

AASB 15 establishes principles for reporting the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash
flows arising from an entity’s contracts with customers and requires application of a five-step process to identify
the contract with the customer, identify performance obligations in the contract, determine transaction price,
allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations and recognise revenue when performance
obligations are satisfied.

Revenue is recognised for the major business activities as follows:

_(i)_ _Data centre services_
Data centre services revenue primarily consist of recurring monthly service fees and upfront project fees.

Revenue from the provision of recurring monthly service fees is recognised in the accounting period in which the
services are rendered. Project fees primarily comprise installation services relating to a customer’s initial
deployment. As this is not considered to be a distinct service, revenue is deferred and recognised over the term
of the contract with the customer, taking into account renewal options that are held by the customer.

The Group applies the practical expedient in the revenue standard and does not disclose information about the
transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations on contracts that are unsatisfied, as the Group
has the right to consideration from its customers in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the
customer of the Group’s services to date. This is applied to all its data centre services revenue, on the basis that
the upfront project fees are not a significant portion of each contract.

The Group enters into contracts with customers that guarantee certain performance measures such as uptime
and on time delivery of services. If these guarantees of service performance are not achieved, the Group reduces
revenue for any credits or cash payments that may be due to customers under contract. Key areas of estimation
include the amount of the service credits, the likelihood that the service credits will be claimed, and the time
period over which they impact revenue.

Customer incentives provided by way of upfront discounts are contract assets that are amortised via a reduction
in revenue over the expected contract life - refer to note 7(c).

_(ii) Rental revenue from landbank properties_
Rental revenue from landbank properties relates to rental revenue received from short term tenants occupying
properties purchased for future expansion activities.

_(iii) Interest income_
Interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of a financial
asset, except for financial assets that subsequently become credit-impaired. For credit-impaired financial assets,
the effective interest rate is applied to the net carrying amount of the financial asset (after deduction of the loss
allowance).

During the year ended 30 June 2022, NEXTDC completed an amendment to its existing Senior Debt Facilities.
The refinance was deemed a modification of the original facility, and a modification gain of $26.5 million was
recognised immediately in profit and loss. Establishment fees of $23.3 million were written off on these facilities in
the prior year.

**(a) Trade receivables**

_(i) Classification as trade receivables_

Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for goods sold or services performed in the ordinary course
of business. They are generally due for settlement within 30 - 60 days and therefore are all classified as current.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at the amount of consideration that is unconditional unless they contain
significant financing components, when they are recognised at fair value. The Group holds the trade receivables
with the objective to collect the contractual cash flows and therefore measures them subsequently at amortised
cost using the effective interest method.

_(ii) Fair values of trade and other receivables_

Due to the short-term nature of the trade and other receivables, their carrying amount is considered to be the
same as their fair value.

_(iii) Impairment and risk exposure_

Information about the Group's impairment policies, calculation of loss allowance and exposure to credit risk,
foreign currency risk and interest rate risk can be found in note 14.

**(b) Interest receivable**

Interest receivable relates to interest accrued on term deposits. Credit risk of this is assessed in the same
manner as cash and cash equivalents which is detailed in note 14.

**Total other assets - non-current** **18,565** **14,168**

**(a) Capitalised transaction costs**

Fees paid on establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan. To the extent that it
is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is deferred until draw down occurs, at which
point it will be amortised over the remaining term of the facility. To the extent there is no evidence that it is
probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a prepayment for liquidity
services and amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates. Refer to note 15 for further details on the
Group's loan facilities.

**(b) Security deposits**

Included in the security deposits was $9.2 million (2022: $8.8 million) relating to deposits held as security for
bank guarantees.

**(c) Customer incentives**

The customer incentive balance includes amounts where customers are offered incentives in the form of free or
discounted periods. It also includes amounts paid to customers where guarantees of service performance are not
achieved as set out in Note 4(b)(i). In these cases, the dollar value of the incentive or cash payment is recorded
as an asset and amortised on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract as described in Note 4(b)(i).

**(d) Contract costs**

Eligible costs that are expected to be recovered are capitalised as a contract cost and amortised over the
expected customer life.

_(i) Recognition and measurement_

Trade and other payables, including accruals, are recorded when the Group is required to make future payments
as a result of purchases of assets or services provided to the Group prior to the end of financial period. The
amounts are unsecured and are usually paid within 30 days of recognition. Trade and other payables are
presented as current liabilities unless payment is not due within 12 months from the reporting date. They are
recognised initially at their fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest
method.

_(ii) Fair values of trade and other payables_

Due to the short-term nature of trade and other payables, their carrying amount is considered to be the same as
their fair value.

_(iii) Risk Exposure_

As the majority of payables are in Australian dollars, management does not believe there are any significant risks
in relation to these financial liabilities. Refer to note 14 for details of the Group’s financial risk management
policies.

**9** **Property, plant and equipment (continued)**

**(a) Property, plant and equipment**

Land and buildings are shown at historical cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated
impairment losses.

Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less depreciation. Costs capitalised include external
direct costs of materials and services and employee costs.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate,
only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost
of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of any component accounted for as a separate asset
is derecognised when replaced. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the Consolidated Statement of
Comprehensive Income during the year in which they are incurred.

Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost, net of their residual
values, over their estimated useful lives as follows:

**Category** **Useful life**
Buildings 40 years
Plant and machinery 2-25 years
Computer equipment 1-15 years
Office furniture and equipment 5-10 years
Right-of-use assets 1-99 years

The assets' residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each
reporting year, considering key assumptions including changes in technology, physical conditions and potential
climate change implications.

An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount
is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing

**10 Intangible assets (continued)**

**(a) Intangible assets**

**RIGHTS AND LICENCES**

Certain licences that NEXTDC possesses have an indefinite useful life and are carried at cost less impairment
losses and are subject to impairment review at least annually and whenever there is an indication that it may be
impaired.

Other licences that NEXTDC acquires are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated
impairment losses. Amortisation is recognised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life which is
generally 25 years. The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each annual
reporting period.

**INTERNALLY GENERATED SOFTWARE**

Internally developed software is capitalised at cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated
using the straight-line basis over the asset’s useful economic life which is generally four to seven years. Their
useful lives and potential impairment are reviewed at the end of each financial year.

Costs incurred in configuring or customising SaaS arrangements can only be recognised as intangible assets if
the implementation activities create an intangible asset that the entity controls and the intangible asset meets the
recognition criteria. Those costs that do not result in intangible assets are expensed as incurred, unless they are
paid to the suppliers of the SaaS arrangements to significantly customise the cloud-based software for the Group,
in which case the costs are recorded as a prepayment for services and amortised over the expected renewable
term of the arrangement.

**SOFTWARE UNDER DEVELOPMENT**

Costs incurred in developing products or systems and costs incurred in acquiring software and licenses that will
contribute to future period financial benefits through revenue generation and/or cost reduction are capitalised to
software and systems. Costs capitalised include external direct costs of services and employee costs.

Assets in the course of construction include only those costs directly attributable to the development phase and
are only recognised following completion of technical feasibility and where the Group has an intention and ability
to use the asset.

**11 Leases**

**(a) Leases**

Land **50,091** - 

**143,049** **70,423**

-  included in the line item ‘Property, plant and equipment’ in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

**Lease liabilities**
Current **6,681** 6,232
Non-current **69,963** 70,628

**76,644** **76,860**

Additions to the right-of-use assets during the 2023 financial year totalled $78.1 million composed of $50.3 million
to Land, $27.3 million to Connectivity links and additions to Properties of $0.5 million (2022 : nil).

_(ii) Amounts recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income_
The Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income shows the following amounts relating to leases:

Depreciation charge on Properties **3,863** 3,817

Depreciation charge on Land **219** - 
Interest expense (included in Finance costs) **5,542** 5,537

**11,041** **9,851**

The total cash outflow for leases in 2023 was $6.2 million (2022 : $6.0 million).

_(iii) The Group’s leasing activities and how these are accounted for_
The Group has a number of leases over property, motor vehicles, and connectivity links that have varying terms,
escalation clauses and renewal rights.

Leases are recognised as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset
is available for use by the Group. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The
finance cost is charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income over the lease term so as to
produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each year. The
right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line
basis.

(continued)

**11 Leases (continued)**

**(a) Leases (continued)**

_(iii) The Group’s leasing activities and how these are accounted for (continued)_

Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include
the net present value of the following lease payments:

-  fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable

-  variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate

-  amounts expected to be payable by the Group under residual value guarantees

-  the exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and

-  payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising that option.

Lease payments to be made under reasonably certain extension options are also included in the measurement of
the liability.

The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily
determined, which is generally the case for leases in the Group, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is used.

To determine the incremental borrowing rate, the Group:

-  where possible, uses recent third-party financing received by the individual lessee as a starting point,
adjusted to reflect changes in financing conditions since third party financing was received

-  makes adjustments specific to the lease, eg. term, country, currency and security.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:

-  the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability

-  any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received

-  any initial direct costs, and

-  restoration costs.

Payments associated with short-term leases of equipment and vehicles and all leases of low-value assets are
recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise IT equipment
and small items of office furniture.

_(iv) Extension and termination options_
Extension and termination options are included in a number of property and equipment leases across the Group.
These are used to maximise operational flexibility in terms of managing the assets used in the Group’s
operations. The majority of extension and termination options held are exercisable only by the Group and not by
the respective lessor.

**Capital and financial risk management**

**12 Capital risk management**

The Group's objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern, so that
it can continue to provide returns to its shareholders and benefits to its stakeholders and to maintain an optimal
capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.

In the future, the Directors may pursue funding options such as debt, sale and leaseback of assets, additional
equity and various other funding mechanisms as appropriate in order to undertake its projects and deliver
optimum shareholders’ return.

The Group intends to maintain a gearing ratio appropriate for a company of its size and growth.

The change in the gearing ratio was primarily driven by the equity fundraising activities during the period. Refer to
note 13 for movements in ordinary share capital.

The Group manages its capital structure by regularly reviewing its gearing ratio to ensure it maintains an
appropriate level of gearing within facility covenants. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital.
Net debt is calculated as total interest bearing financial liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents. Total capital is
calculated as equity, as shown in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, plus net debt.

Ordinary shares entitle the holder to participate in dividends and the proceeds on winding up of the Group in
proportion to the number of and amounts paid on the shares held. On a show of hands every holder of ordinary
shares present at a meeting in person or by proxy, is entitled to one vote, and upon a poll each share is entitled
to one vote.

Ordinary shares have no par value and the Group does not have a limited amount of authorised capital.

**(d) Performance rights and deferred share rights**

Performance rights and deferred share rights, which subject to satisfaction of a performance hurdle, give rise to
an entitlement to the value of an ordinary share in NEXTDC Limited. The Board has discretion to determine if the
value will be provided in shares, cash or a combination of shares and cash. The Board determined that 100% of
the FY20 LTI and those FY21 deferred STIs that elected to take shares rather than cash, would vest in shares,
with 45,137 and 730,203 ordinary shares issued on 16 and 21 September 2022 respectively.

**(e) Loan funded share plan**

The Group operated a legacy Loan Funded Share Plan remuneration scheme which was designed to attract and
retain key employees. The arrangement involved the issue of shares to NEXTDC Share Plan Pty Ltd, whose sole
purpose was to hold shares as trustee for its beneficiaries (its participants). The participants were required to
meet service requirements before being entitled to access these shares.

The fair value at grant date of the shares was determined using either a Black-Scholes or binomial option pricing
model that took into account the exercise price, the term of the option, the impact of dilution, the share price at
grant date and expected price volatility of the underlying share, the expected dividend yield and the risk-free
interest rate for the term of the loan. The assessed fair value was recognised as share-based payments.

**14 Financial risk management**

The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including interest rate risk and price
risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group's overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of
financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group.

During the financial year, NEXTDC secured an incremental $400 million in senior debt capacity, bringing the
facility to a new aggregate limit of $2.9 billion, as well as favourable amendments to existing financial covenants
and terms.

The Company's $2.9 billion Syndicated Debt Facilities comprise the following tranches:

-  $800 million - Term Loan Facility (fully drawn)

-  $600 million - Capital Expenditure Facility ($400 million undrawn)

-  $800 million - Revolving Credit Facility (multi-currency) (undrawn)

-  $300 million - Term Loan Facility (fully drawn)

-  $100 million - New Term Loan Facility (fully drawn)

-  $300 million - New Revolving Credit Facility (undrawn)

The facilities have a maturity date of 3 December 2026, except for the $300 million Term Loan Facility, which has
a maturity date of 3 December 2028.

NEXTDC is exposed to interest rate volatility due to the variable rate on its Syndicated Debt Facilities. To mitigate
the interest rate risk associated with this floating element, NEXTDC has entered into a series of interest rate
swaps under which, the amounts drawn under the facilities have their base interest fixed until 3 December 2024.

A derivative asset and associated cash flow hedge reserve has been taken up at 30 June 2023 to account for
these transactions.

The Group’s transactions are predominantly conducted in Australian dollars. Overall, management assesses the
Group’s exposure to financial risk as low. However, the Group does have a financial risk management program in
place. The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments for speculative purposes.

**Closing balance 30 June 2023** **(472)** **23,893** **23,421**

_Hedge effectiveness_
Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective
effectiveness assessments, to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging
instrument.

The Group enters into interest rate swaps that have similar critical terms as the hedged item, such as reference
rate, reset dates, payment dates, maturities and notional amount. As all critical terms matched during the year,
there is an economic relationship.

**(b) Market risk**

Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of
changes in market prices. Market risk for the Group is comprised of foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk.

_(i)_ _Foreign exchange risk_
The Group does not currently have any significant operations outside Australia and its transactions are
predominantly conducted in Australian dollars. Consequently, management has determined that the Group has
little exposure to foreign exchange risk. On this basis, the Group does not have any active risk mitigation
strategies in relation to foreign exchange risk.

**14 Financial risk management (continued)**

**(b) Market risk (continued)**

_(ii) Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk_
The Group’s main interest rate risk arises from its various fixed-rate term deposits and its syndicated debt facility
(refer to note 15(a)). The floating rate loan tranches expose the Group's borrowings to changes in interest rates.
The embedded interest rates for the lease liabilities are fixed, consequently the interest rate risk in relation to
these instruments is limited.

_Instruments used by the group_
The Group has incorporated derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rates. Under its
interest rate swaps, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between the contracted fixed and floating rate
interest amounts determined on a notional principal amount. Within these interest rate swaps, there is embedded
floor protection at 0%, which is consistent with the terms of the underlying senior debt facility.

The following table details the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate swap contracts
outstanding at the end of the reporting period:

**(c) Credit risk**

Credit risk arises from counterparties holding cash and cash equivalents, security deposits, trade and other
receivables, and derivatives.

_(i)_ _Cash and cash equivalents and security deposits_
Deposits are placed with Australian banks or independently rated parties with a minimum rating of ‘A’ class in
both short term and long term. To reduce exposure deposits are placed with a variety of financial institutions.

The credit quality of financial assets can be assessed by reference to external credit ratings (if available) or to
historical information about counterparty default rates:
**30 June** 30 June
**2023** 2022
**$'000** $'000

**CASH AT BANK**
A rated **202,546** 93,826
AA rated **563,295** 362,736
**TOTAL** **765,841** **456,562**

**SECURITY DEPOSITS**
AA Rated **9,155** 8,840
Unrated **510** 2,103
**TOTAL** **9,665** **10,943**

In determining the credit quality of these financial assets, NEXTDC has used the long-term rating from Standard
& Poor’s as of July 2023.

_(ii) Trade and other receivables_
Customer credit risk is managed subject to the Group’s established policy, procedures and control relating to
customer credit risk management. Credit evaluations are performed on all customers. Outstanding customer
receivables are monitored regularly.

The Group aims to minimise concentration of credit risk by undertaking transactions with a large number of
customers. Revenues from data centre services of $168.8m were derived from two customers, contributing
$87.4m (24%) and $81.4m (22%) respectively (2022: $66.7m (23%) and $64.0m (22%) respectively). Revenues
from these two customers were derived across numerous orders at multiple data centre facilities with the
underlying orders having a range of different expiry dates. In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an
ongoing basis with the intention that the Group’s exposure to bad debts is minimised.

The maximum exposure to credit risk at the end of the reporting period is the carrying value of each class of the
financial assets mentioned above and each class of receivable disclosed in Note 6. The Group does not require
collateral in respect of financial assets.

**(c) Credit risk (continued)**

_(ii) Trade and other receivables (continued)_
The Group applies the simplified approach to providing for expected credit losses prescribed by AASB 9, which
permits the use of the lifetime expected loss provision for all trade receivables.

To measure the expected credit loss, receivables have been grouped based on days overdue. The methodology
applied in estimating expected credit losses below is consistent with that applied for the year ended 30 June
2022.

The judgements and associated assumptions have been made within the context of the impact of COVID-19,
higher interest rate environment, and reflect historical experience as well as other factors that are considered to
be relevant, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the current
circumstances, such as the duration of the pandemic, economic impact of higher interest rates, the actions of
governments, the responses of businesses and consumers across different industries, and the associated impact
on the global economy. Accordingly, the Group's expected credit loss estimates are inherently uncertain, and as
a result, actual results may differ from these estimates.

_(iii) Derivatives_
Credit risk for derivative financial instruments arises from the potential failure by counterparties to the derivative
transaction contract to meet their obligations. The credit risk exposure to interest rate swaps is the fair value of
these contracts. All derivative financial instruments are with our major international banking partners, all of which
have a minimum credit rating of ‘A’ in the long-term rating from Standard & Poor’s as of July 2023.

**(a) Bank loan**

The Company's $2.9 billion Syndicated Debt Facilities comprise the following tranches:

-  $800 million - Term Loan Facility (fully drawn)

-  $600 million - Capital Expenditure Facility ($400 million undrawn)

-  $800 million - Revolving Credit Facility (multi-currency) (undrawn)

-  $300 million - Term Loan Facility (fully drawn)

-  $100 million - New Term Loan Facility (fully drawn)

-  $300 million - New Revolving Credit Facility (undrawn)

The $300 million Term Loan Facility has a maturity of 3 December 2028, while the remaining $800 million Term
Loan Facility, $600 million Capital Expenditure Facility and $800 million Revolving Credit Facility have a maturity
date of 3 December 2026.

On 13 January 2023, NEXTDC Limited announced that it had entered into a new Syndicated Facility Agreement
in relation to a new $400 million senior debt facility, of which $100 million was drawn on 15 February 2023 with
$300 million remaining on a Revolving Credit Facility, both of which have a maturity date of 3 December 2026.

NEXTDC is exposed to interest rate volatility due to the variable rate on its Syndicated Debt Facilities. To mitigate
the interest rate risk associated with this floating element, NEXTDC has entered into a series of interest rate
swaps under which, the amounts drawn under the facilities have their base interest rate fixed until 3 December
2024.

A derivative asset and associated cash flow hedge reserve has been taken up at 30 June 2023 to account for
these transactions.

The Syndicated Debt Facilities are secured by the Group's properties.

**(b) Compliance with loan covenants**

The Group has complied with the financial covenants of its borrowing facilities during the 2023 financial year
(2022: complied).

**15 Borrowings (continued)**

**(d) Borrowings**

Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently
measured at amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption
amount is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income over the period of the borrowings
using the effective interest method. Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as
transaction costs of the loan. To the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down,
the fee is deferred until the draw down occurs, at which point it will be amortised over the remaining term of the
facility. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the
fee is capitalised as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of the facility to which it
relates.

**(a) Performance rights**

The performance rights plan was established by the Board of Directors to provide long-term incentives to the
Group’s Senior Executives based on total shareholder returns (TSR) taking into account the Group’s financial
and operational performance. Under the Plan, eligible participants may be granted performance rights on terms
and conditions determined by the Board from time to time. Outstanding performance rights were granted during
the course of FY21, FY22 and FY23. The vesting conditions for the FY21 grant relate to TSR exceeding the ASX
200 Accumulation Index over the measurement period, while the vesting conditions for the FY22 and FY23
grants relate to TSR exceeding the ASX 100 Accumulation Index over the measurement period. Vesting of the
FY21 rights will be tested on or around the day following the release of the annual results for the year ended 30
June 2023. The FY22 and FY23 rights include tranches which vest after the third and fourth years, and will be
tested on or around the day following the release of each of the annual results for 2024, 2025 and 2026
respectively.

Performance rights are granted by the Company for nil consideration. The Board has discretion to determine if
the value will be provided in shares, cash or a combination of shares and cash. Rights granted under the plan
carry no dividend or voting rights.

The fair value of the rights at the date of valuation was determined using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model
to be equal to the volume weighted-average price (VWAP) ending on the day before the grant date, less the
dividends expected over the period from the expected grant date to the completion of the measurement period,
adjusted for the expected probability of achieving the vesting conditions.

**(b) Deferred shares - executives short-term incentive scheme**

Under the Group’s short-term incentive (STI) scheme for FY22, executives received 50% of the annual STI
achieved in cash, with 50% deferred for 12 months. Executives were able to elect whether the deferred
component would be delivered in cash or equity. The FY22 tranche of deferred rights were granted in September
2022 and will vest on or around September 2023, being 12 months after the date on which they were granted.
They automatically convert into one ordinary share each on vesting at an exercise price of nil. The executives do
not receive any dividends and are not entitled to vote in relation to the deferred shares during the vesting period.
If an executive ceases to be employed by the Group within this period, they will have 6 months from cessation of
employment or the vesting date (whichever is later) to exercise the deferred share right. Any rights not exercised
within this period will automatically lapse.

The number of rights to be granted was determined based on the currency value of the achieved STI divided by
the volume weighted-average price at which the Company’s shares were traded on the Australian Securities
Exchange over the 10 days following the release of the Group's FY22 results, being $10.09.

**21 Income tax (continued)**

**(d) Tax losses (continued)**

**Income tax**

The income tax expense or revenue for the period is the tax payable on the current period’s taxable income
based on the applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and
liabilities attributable to temporary differences and to unused tax losses.

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the
end of the reporting period in Australia. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with
respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where
appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.

Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the
tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. However, deferred tax
liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred income tax is also not
accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business
combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred
income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end
of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the
deferred income tax liability is settled.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is
probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets
and liabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. Current tax assets and
tax liabilities are offset where the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends either to settle on a
net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Current and deferred tax is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, except to the
extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax
is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.

Deferred tax assets may be a combination of unused tax losses, offsets and timing differences based on
management’s foreseeable forecasts, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against
which the losses, offsets and timing differences can be utilised. Significant management judgement is required to
determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and level of
future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies.

In FY20 the Group derecognised deferred tax assets in relation to carry-forward tax losses and temporary
differences as it believed they no longer met the requirement to be recognised, stemming from the impact that
the recent growth and expansion activity has had on taxable profits. Despite the derecognition, these
carry-forward tax losses and offsets can be carried forward indefinitely and have no expiry date.

_(i)_ _Significant judgement: existence of significant influence_
On 22 November 2021, NEXTDC Limited acquired a 19.99% interest in an ASX listed entity, Sovereign Cloud
Holdings (ASX: SOV), via an upfront placement of $12.4 million. Following the placement, NEXTDC acquired a
further $4.5 million in shares via a follow-on pro rata entitlement offer to maintain its 19.99%
shareholding.Transaction costs of $1.1 million incurred as part of the acquisition have been capitalised against
the investment.

Following acquisition, NEXTDC Limited was entitled to one seat on the board of Sovereign Cloud Holdings and
now participates in all significant financial and operating decisions.

On 29 June 2023, NEXTDC Limited acquired a further $4.0m in shares via a pro-rata non-renounceable
entitlement offer, increasing its shareholding to 33.61%. With the increased ownership and continued board set,
the Group maintains that it has significant influence over this entity.

_(iii) Impairment_
NEXTDC's 33.61% stake in Sovereign Cloud Holdings Limited (ASX: SOV) was tested for impairment at the
reporting date. While the strategic merit and underlying business case behind the Company's investment in SOV
remains unchanged an impairment indicator was identified due to SOV shares trading to $0.055 per share at 30
June 2023.

Given the difference between SOV's trading price and the carrying value of SOV shares in NEXTDC's accounts,
the Company has determined an impairment charge of $1.8 million should be taken up for the year ended 30
June 2023.

**26 Parent entity financial information (continued)**

**(e) Determining the parent entity financial information**

The financial information for the parent entity has been prepared on the same basis as the consolidated financial
statements, except as set out below.

_(i)_ _Tax consolidation legislation_
NEXTDC Limited and its wholly-owned Australian controlled entities have implemented the tax consolidation
legislation.

The head entity, NEXTDC Limited, and the controlled entities in the tax consolidated Group account for their own
current and deferred tax amounts. These tax amounts are measured as if each entity in the tax consolidated
Group continues to be a stand-alone taxpayer in its own right.

In addition to its own current and deferred tax amounts, NEXTDC Limited also recognises the current tax
liabilities (or assets) and the deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses and unused tax credits assumed
from controlled entities in the tax consolidated Group.

The entities have also entered into a tax funding agreement under which the wholly-owned entities fully
compensate NEXTDC Limited for any current tax payable assumed and are compensated by NEXTDC Limited
for any current tax receivable and deferred tax assets relating to unused tax losses or unused tax credits that are
transferred to NEXTDC Limited under the tax consolidation legislation. The funding amounts are determined by
reference to the amounts recognised in the wholly-owned entities’ financial statements.

The amounts receivable/payable under the tax funding agreement are due upon receipt of the funding advice
from the head entity, which is issued as soon as practicable after the end of each financial year. The head entity
may also require payment of interim funding amounts to assist with its obligations to pay tax instalments.

Assets or liabilities arising under tax funding agreements with the tax consolidated entities are recognised as
current amounts receivable from or payable to other entities in the Group.

Any difference between the amounts assumed and amounts receivable or payable under the tax funding
agreement are recognised as a contribution to (or distribution from) wholly-owned tax consolidated entities.

_(ii) Investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint venture entities_
Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost in the financial statements of NEXTDC Limited.

**27 Summary of significant accounting policies**

The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set
out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated. The
financial statements are for the consolidated entity consisting of NEXTDC Limited and its subsidiaries. NEXTDC
is a public company limited by shares, incorporated and domiciled in Australia.

**(a) Reporting Period and Comparative information**

These financial statements cover the period 1 July 2022 to 30 June 2023. The comparative reporting period is 1
July 2021 to 30 June 2022.

**(b) Basis of preparation**

This general purpose financial report has been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards
and interpretations issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board and the Corporations Act 2001.
NEXTDC Limited is a for-profit entity for the purpose of preparing the financial statements.

_(i)_ _Compliance with IFRS_
The consolidated financial statements of the NEXTDC Group also comply with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).

The consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on the date the
Directors' Report is signed. The Directors have the power to amend and reissue the financial statements.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Report

(continued)

**27 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)**

**(b) Basis of preparation (continued)**

_(i)_ _Compliance with IFRS (continued)_

_(ii) New and amended standards adopted by the group_

None of the new standards and amendments to standards that are mandatory for the first time for the financial
year beginning 1 July 2022 affected any of the amounts recognised in the current period or any prior period and
are not likely to affect future periods.

_(iii) Historical cost convention_
These financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for derivatives
measured at fair value.

_(iv) New standards and interpretations not yet adopted_

There are no standards that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group
in the current or future reporting periods and on foreseeable future transactions.

**(c) Critical accounting estimates**

Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors,
including expectations of future events that may have a financial impact on the entity and that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances.

This note provides an overview of the areas that involved a higher degree of judgement or complexity, and of
items which are more likely to be materially adjusted due to estimates and assumptions turning out to be wrong.

_(i)_ _Deferred taxation_
Deferred tax assets may be a combination of unused tax losses, offsets and timing differences based on
management’s foreseeable forecasts, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against
which the losses, offsets and timing differences can be utilised. Significant management judgement is required to
determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and level of
future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies.

The Group previously derecognised deferred tax assets in relation to carry-forward tax losses and temporary
differences as it believed they no longer met the requirement to be recognised, stemming from the impact that
the recent growth and expansion activity has had on taxable profits. Despite the derecognition, these
carry-forward tax losses and offsets can be carried forward indefinitely and have no expiry date.

_(ii) Income taxes_
The Group is subject to income taxes in the jurisdictions in which it operates. Judgement is required in
determining the provision for income taxes. There are certain transactions and calculations undertaken during the
ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The Group estimates its tax
liabilities based on the Group’s understanding of the tax law. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is
different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current and deferred
income tax assets and liabilities in the period in which such determination is made.

_(iii) Leases_
The Group is required to determine the measurement of lease liabilities based on the present value of remaining
lease payments, discounted using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate at commencement date. Judgement is
required in determining an appropriate incremental borrowing rate, and the Group has determined the rate based
on the effective interest rate of its most recent borrowings, adjusted to the specific term of each lease. In
determining the lease term, management considered all relevant facts and circumstances that create an
economic incentive to either exercise an extension option, or not exercise a termination option. Extension options
are only included in the lease term if it is reasonably certain to be extended. The assessment is reviewed if a
significant event or significant change in circumstances occurs which affects this assessment, and that is within
the control of the lessee.

**27 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)**

**(c) Critical accounting estimates (continued)**

_(iv) Revenue from contracts with customers_
Key judgements in the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers include the identification of
performance obligations within the contracts, allocation of the transaction price within the contract to the identified
performance obligations, treatment of the upfront project fees and treatment of any variable consideration
subsequent to initial commencement. Refer to Note 4 for further details.

_(v) Impairment_
Assessment of indicators of impairment and the determination of CGUs for impairment purposes require
significant management judgment. Indicators of impairment may include changes in the Group's operating and
economic assumptions or possible impacts from emerging risks such as climate change and the transition to a
low carbon economy. Considering the location and nature of our assets as well as our continued focus on
operational resilience and business continuity programs, at this stage, we do not consider the potential impacts of
climate change and the transition to a low carbon economy to be an impairment indicator.

**(d) Employee Share Trust**

The Group has formed two entities to administer the Group's employee share schemes. The trusts are
consolidated, as the substance of the relationships are that the trusts are controlled by the Group. Shares held by
NEXTDC Share Plan Pty Ltd and NEXTDC Employee Share Plan Trust are disclosed as treasury shares and
deducted from contributed equity.

**(e) Share-based payments reserve**

The share-based payments reserve is used to recognise:

-  the grant date fair value of long-term incentives issued to participants

-  the grant date fair value of shares issued to participants

-  the issue of shares held by NEXTDC Share Plan Pty Ltd and NEXTDC Employee Share Plan Trust

**(f)** **Functional and presentation currency**

These consolidated financial statements are presented in Australian dollars, which is the Group’s functional
currency.

**(g) Impairment of assets**

Intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for
impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they might be impaired. Other
assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount
exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell
and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which
there are separately identifiable cash inflows which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets
or groups of assets (cash-generating units). Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffered impairment are
reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at the end of each reporting period.

Consideration has been given to the potential financial impacts of climate change related risks on the carrying
value of the Group's assets through a qualitative review of the Group's climate change risks and mitigating
actions. This review did not identify any material financial reporting impacts.

**(h) Cash and cash equivalents**

For the purpose of presentation in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents
includes cash on hand, deposits held at call with financial institutions and term deposits with original maturities of
three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an
insignificant risk of changes in value.

**27 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)**

**(i)** **Investments and other financial assets**

_(i)_ _Classification_
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:

-  those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through OCI or through profit or loss), and

-  those to be measured at amortised cost.

The classification depends on the entity’s business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual
terms of the cash flows.

For assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will either be recorded in profit or loss or OCI. For
investments in equity instruments that are not held for trading, this will depend on whether the Group has made
an irrevocable election at the time of initial recognition to account for the equity investment at fair value through
other comprehensive income (FVOCI).

The Group reclassifies debt investments when and only when its business model for managing those assets
changes.

_(ii) Measurement_
At initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset
not at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of
the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at FVPL are expensed in profit or loss.

_Debt instruments_
Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Group’s business model for managing the asset
and the cash flow characteristics of the asset. There are three measurement categories into which the Group
classifies its debt instruments:

-  Amortised cost: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent
solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. Interest income from these
financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. Any gain or loss arising
on derecognition is recognised directly in profit or loss and presented in other gains/(losses) together with
foreign exchange gains and losses. Impairment losses are presented as separate line item in the
consolidated income statement.

-  FVOCI: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets, where
the assets’ cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at FVOCI.
Movements in the carrying amount are taken through OCI, except for the recognition of impairment gains or
losses, interest income and foreign exchange gains and losses which are recognised in profit or loss. When
the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified
from equity to profit or loss and recognised in other gains/(losses). Interest income from these financial
assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. Foreign exchange gains and
losses are presented in other gains/(losses) and impairment expenses are presented as separate line item in
the consolidated income statement.

-  FVPL: Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at FVPL. A gain or loss
on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at FVPL is recognised in profit or loss and presented net
within other gains/(losses) in the year in which it arises.

_Equity instruments_
The Group subsequently measures all equity investments at fair value. Where the Group’s management has
elected to present fair value gains and losses on equity investments in OCI, there is no subsequent
reclassification of fair value gains and losses to profit or loss following the derecognition of the investment.
Dividends from such investments continue to be recognised in profit or loss as other income when the Group’s
right to receive payments is established.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Report
30 June 2023
(continued)

**27 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)**

**(i)** **Investments and other financial assets (continued)**

_(ii) Measurement (continued)_
_Equity instruments (continued)_
Changes in the fair value of financial assets at FVPL are recognised in other gains/(losses) in the consolidated
income statement as applicable. Impairment losses (and reversal of impairment losses) on equity investments
measured at FVOCI are not reported separately from other changes in fair value.

_(iii) Impairment_
The group assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its debt instruments
carried at amortised cost and FVOCI. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been
a significant increase in credit risk. For trade receivables, the group applies the simplified approach permitted by
AASB 9, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables, see
note 14 for further details.

**(j)** **Derivatives and hedging activities**

_(i)_ _Classification of derivatives_
Derivatives are only used for economic hedging purposes and not as speculative investments. However, where
derivatives do not meet the hedge accounting criteria, they are classified as ‘held for trading’ for accounting
purposes and are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss. They are presented as current assets or
liabilities to the extent they are expected to be settled within 12 months after the end of the reporting period.

The Group designates derivatives as hedges of a particular risk associated with the cash flows of recognised
assets and liabilities and highly probably forecast transactions (cash flow hedge). At inception of the hedge
relationship, the Group documents the economic relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items
including whether changes in the cash flows of the hedging instruments are expected to offset changes in the
cash flows of hedged items. The Group documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking its
hedge transactions.

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow
hedges is recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve within equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective
portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss, within other gains/(losses).

The Group designates interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of highly probable forecast interest. The interest
rate swaps have floor options embedded within; in this case the Group designates only the intrinsic value of the
options as the hedging instrument.

Gains or losses relating to the effective portion of the change in intrinsic value of the options are recognised in
the cash flow hedge reserve within equity. The changes in the fair value of the aligned time value of the option
are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the cost of hedging reserve. If the hedged
item is transaction-related, the time value is reclassified to profit or loss when the hedged item affects profit or
loss.

If the hedged item is time period related, then the amount accumulated in the cost of hedging reserve is
reclassified to profit or loss on a rational basis. Those reclassified amounts are recognised in profit or loss in the
same line as the hedged item. If the hedged item is a non-financial item, then the amount accumulated in the cost
of hedging reserve is removed directly from equity and included in the initial carrying amount of the recognised
non-financial item. Furthermore, if the Group expects that some or all of the loss accumulated in cost of hedging
reserve will not be recovered in the future, that amount is immediately reclassified to profit or loss.

_(ii) Fair Value measurement_
The fair value of the interest rate swaps which the group has entered into are not traded in an active market (for
example, over-the-counter derivatives), and are determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use
of observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity-specific estimates. Given all significant inputs
required to fair value these interest rate swaps are observable, the instrument is classified as level 2.


-----

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Report
30 June 2023
(continued)

**27 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)**

**(k) Provisions**

Provisions for asset replacement and make good obligations are recognised when the Group has a present legal
or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to
settle the obligation and the amount has been reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognised for future
operating losses.

Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is
determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of
an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.

Provisions are measured at the present value of management's best estimate of the expenditure required to
settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting year. The discount rate used to determine the present
value is a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific
to the liability. The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as interest expense.

**(l)** **Employee benefits**

_(i) Short-term Obligations_
Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits and annual leave expected to be settled within
12 months after the end of each reporting period in which the employees render the related service are
recognised in respect of employees’ services up to the end of the reporting period and are measured at the
amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled. The liability for annual leave is recognised in
payables.

_(ii) Other long-term employee benefit Obligations_
The liability for long service leave and annual leave which is not expected to be settled within 12 months after the
end of the reporting period in which the employees render the related service is recognised in the provision for
employee benefits and measured as the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of
services provided by employees up to the end of the reporting period. Consideration is given to expected future
wage and salary levels, experience of employee departures and periods of service. Expected future payments
are discounted using market yields at the end of the reporting period on national government bonds with terms to
maturity and currency that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows.

_(iii) Share-based Payments_
Share-based compensation benefits are provided to participants via the Long Term Incentive Plan.

The fair value of performance rights is recognised as an employee benefits expense with a corresponding
increase in equity. The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value granted, which
includes any market performance conditions and the impact of any non-vesting conditions but excludes the
impact of any service and non-market performance vesting conditions.

Non-market vesting conditions are included in the assumptions. The total expense is recognised over the vesting
period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied. At the end of each
period, the Group revises its estimates of the number of rights that are expected to vest based on the non-market
vesting conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the Consolidated
Statement of Comprehensive Income, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.

_(iv) Retirement benefit Obligations_
Except for the statutory superannuation guarantee charge, the Group does not have any other retirement benefit
obligations.

**(m) Rounding of amounts**

The Company is of a kind referred to in ASIC Corporations (Rounding in Financial/Directors' Reports) Instrument
2016/191, relating to the ‘rounding off’ of amounts in the financial statements. Amounts in the financial
statements have been rounded off in accordance with that Class Order to the nearest thousand dollars, or in
certain cases, to the nearest dollar.

**27 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)**

**(n) Goods and Services Tax (GST)**

Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of associated GST, unless the GST incurred
is not recoverable from the taxation authority. In this case it is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the
asset or as part of the expense.

Receivables and payables are stated inclusive of the amount of GST receivable or payable. The net amount of
GST recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included with other receivables or payables in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Cash flows are presented on a gross basis. The GST components of cash flows arising from investing or
financing activities which are recoverable from, or payable to the taxation authority, are presented as operating
cash flows.

**(o) Parent entity financial information**

The financial information for the parent entity, NEXTDC Limited, disclosed in note 26 has been prepared on the
same basis as the consolidated financial statements.

**(p) Assets in the course of construction**

Assets in the course of construction are shown at historical cost. Historical cost includes directly attributable
expenditure on data centre facilities which at reporting date, has not yet been finalised and/or ready for use.
Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated.

Assets in the course of construction are transferred to property, plant and equipment upon successful testing and
commissioning.

**(q) Revenue received in advance**

Revenue received in advance primarily relates to the advance consideration received from customers in relation
to project fees and service credits, for which revenue is recognised over time. Refer to Note 4 (b) for details in
relation to the revenue recognition policy for project fees and service credits.

Independent Auditor’s Report

Independent auditor’s report

To the members of NEXTDC Limited

**Report on the audit of the financial report**

**Our opinion**

In our opinion:

**Our audit approach**

An audit is designed to provide reasonable assurance about whether the financial report is free from
material misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if
individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of
users taken on the basis of the financial report.

We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an
opinion on the financial report as a whole, taking into account the geographic and management
structure of the Group, its accounting processes and controls and the industry in which it operates.

**Key audit matters**

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in
our audit of the financial report for the current period. The key audit matters were addressed in the
context of our audit of the financial report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do
not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Further, any commentary on the outcomes of a
particular audit procedure is made in that context.

**Other information**

The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the
information included in the annual report for the year ended 30 June 2023, but does not include the
financial report and our auditor’s report thereon.

Our opinion on the financial report does not cover the other information and accordingly we do not
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon through our opinion on the financial report. We
have issued a separate opinion on the remuneration report.

In connection with our audit of the financial report, our responsibility is to read the other information
and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial
report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of
this auditor’s report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are
required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

**Responsibilities of the directors for the financial report**

The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a
true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001
and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the
financial report that gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to
fraud or error.

In preparing the financial report, the directors are responsible for assessing the ability of the Group to
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the
going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

**Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial report**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a whole is
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that
an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material
if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial report.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial report is located at the Auditing
and Assurance Standards Board website at:
https://www.auasb.gov.au/admin/file/content102/c3/ar1_2020.pdf. This description forms part of our
auditor's report.
