**Operator**

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Smartsheet First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings
Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that this call is being recorded. [Operator
Instructions]

And now at this time, I would like to turn things over to Mr. Aaron Turner, Head of Investor Relations.
Please go ahead, sir.

**Aaron Turner**
_VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer_

Thank you, Bill. Good afternoon, and welcome, everyone, to Smartsheet's First Quarter of Fiscal Year
2024 Earnings Call. We will be discussing the results announced in our press release issued after the
market closed today. With me today are Smartsheet CEO, Mark Mader; and our CFO, Pete Godbole.
Today's call is being webcast and will also be available for replay on our Investor Relations website at
investors.smartsheet.com. There is a slide presentation that accompanies Pete's prepared remarks, which
can be viewed in the Events section of our Investor Relations website.

During this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities
Laws. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and
projections about future events and financial trends. These forward-looking statements are subject to a
number of risks and other factors, including, but not limited to, those described in our SEC filings available
on our Investor Relations website and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov.

Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, our
actual results may differ materially and/or adversely. All forward-looking statements made during this call
are based on information available to us as of today. We do not assume any obligation to update these
statements as a result of new information or future events, except as required by law.

In addition to the U.S. GAAP financials, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A
reconciliation to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is available in the presentation that
accompanies this call, which can also be found on our Investor Relations website.

And with that, let me turn the call over to Mark.

**Mark P. Mader**
_President, CEO & Director_

Thank you, Aaron, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter earnings call for fiscal year
2024. While Pete will provide additional details, I'd like to highlight a few areas of our Q1 performance and
share continued progress in our leadership of the enterprise collaborative work management market.

Smartsheet revenue for the quarter exceeded our guidance and grew by 31% year-over-year to $219.9
million, and billings grew 20% year-over-year to $215.5 million. In Q1, we generated non-GAAP operating
margins of 10%, more than double the high end of our guidance range and free cash flow was $31.3
million.

We ended the quarter with annual recurring revenue of $886 million and more than 12.8 million
Smartsheet users. We continue to see strength with our larger customers with 59 customers expanding
their Smartsheet investment by more than $100,000 and 188 companies expanding by over $50,000 in
Q1. These expansions contributed to a net addition of 85 customers in our greater than $100,000 ACV
customer cohort.

Enterprise expansions for the quarter included Eli Lilly, Motorola Solutions, Foxtel and Novocure, among
others, and we saw new customer wins at companies such as Liberty Media, Hostess Brands and Eight


-----

Eleven Group. We also saw strength in our portfolio of capabilities-based products and our advanced
offering with 143 customers either purchasing advanced for the first time or upgrading to a higher tier.

Additionally, we are on track to launch the self-discovery of 2 of our most popular capabilities at the end
of Q2. This will lower the friction required for our customers to experience these products, which should
result in a faster time to value for our customers as well as for our sales team.

A leading financial services company upgraded to Advance Platinum this quarter. This meaningful
expansion was driven by employee demand for our core platform as well as the premium security and
governance capabilities they receive with Advance Platinum. Over the past year, their user growth has
increased 52% and they have created nearly 180% more WorkApps, 240% more Data Shuttle workflows.
And the company's marketing department is now transitioning from another CWM platform to Smartsheet.

In addition to the momentum we've seen with Advance and our premium capabilities, we're seeing
significant traction with our new free plan. In Q1, we launched our free plan worldwide, and the initial
results are promising with high engagement and conversion to paid in every customer size segment.
These free engaged users should be an impactful component of our user acquisition strategy going
forward. We continue to win due to Smartsheet's position as the enterprise CWM platform that enables
organizations to effectively track and manage 3 critical dimensions of work: people, content and the
work itself. The people dimension reflects the deployment, assignment and capacity planning of those
engaged in the execution of work. Content represents the videos, images, documents and other assets
that are inputs or outputs of the work being done. And work is the information about day-to-day activities,
milestones and workflows that underpin an organization's projects, programs and processes.

By connecting these 3 distinct dimensions of work, the Smartsheet Enterprise platform enables customers
to drive efficiencies across their entire Smartsheet ecosystem and allows them to expand value of the
platform to their partners and customers. For example, one of the world's largest retailers is using
Smartsheet to connect work and people management to unlock value.

Nearly a dozen business units across 5 countries are using Smartsheet to manage their portfolios and
resource management to help them more accurately staff projects. This tighter alignment between
managing work and people allows this retailer to adapt quickly to the changing project needs and gives
them new insights into their team's capacity and performance. And a large online travel company chose
Smartsheet over other CWM solutions because of our ability to help them comprehensively connect the 3
dimensions of work.

The company's global marketing department is going through a major transformation and adding a
significant number of employees this year. Combination of our core offering, resource management and
Brandfolder will help them manage the transition, establish a new unified process for managing campaigns
start to finish and ensure leadership has the right level of insight across the company's brands, products
and programs. They see Smartsheet as an essential way to scale as their department grows, ultimately
helping them achieve their marketing goals.

To further support our large customers, we continue to make investments in scalability of our platform,
greatly improving sheet performance, formula execution and cross sheet data processing. While every
user benefits from these enhancements, they are especially valuable to portfolio managers and their
teams using control center.

We've enabled control center to support thousands of parallel projects already, and we're on track to be
able to support tens of thousands of projects per control center instance by the end of the fiscal year.
And we look forward to sharing more about how we lead the category in scale and manageability at our
Engage Customer Conference in September.

Furthermore, we've seen a major increase in data being transferred from other systems to Smartsheet
with Data Shuttle. In Q1 of last year Data Shuttle ran about 25 million workflows importing and exporting
customer data. And in Q1 of this year, we executed over 53 million workflows transferring tens of billions
of rows of data. Additionally, we have added unified login support in Bridge, up-level administration


-----

capabilities for Data Shuttle and Data Table and doubled the Bridge workflow scale to support customer
demand.

We've expanded our content automation offering for our Brandfolder product with a leading self-serve
templating capability. This is the result of the successful integration of our acquisition of outfit, which is
enabling customers to innovate faster in content production and distribution at scale.

We continue to make improvements in our dashboard capabilities, hundreds of thousands of licensed users
create dashboards to inform stakeholders and drive positive outcomes by centralizing, organizing and
presenting real-time data and statuses on a customizable canvas. We've also introduced policy controls for
cross-functional collaboration and launched the planned insights dashboard, which gives customers a live
view of the value they derive from Smartsheet.

We're experiencing a significant moment for our industry, our customers and our company, generative
AI or Gen AI tools and technologies are rapidly evolving. The way that work gets done from insights
to execution can change materially as a result of Gen AI, and we are using it internally and actively
developing features to benefit our customers. We believe these changes will create new higher-value work
for people opening up opportunities for innovation and more impactful work.

On the product side we continue to make progress on expanding the AI-based capabilities on our platform
and are well positioned to enable valuable customer use cases. This year, we have focused investments in
3 areas of Gen AI that will help our customers work smarter, faster and more effectively.

The first is an intelligent assistant that allows users to quickly find answers that help best use, configure
and extend Smartsheet. The in-app assistant will help customers with everything ranging from early
product discovery to understanding the full impact of the Smartsheet platform across sheets, dashboards,
reports, automations, work apps and more. This will drive adoption of additional capabilities and enhance
the overall Smartsheet experience for our users.

Second, project and portfolio intelligence. By harnessing the power of large language models, we will
further differentiate by allowing users to leverage data within their sheets and use natural language to
generate charts and calculate key metrics that they can save to their dashboards with a click of a button.
These features, combined with Control Centers portfolio capability to quickly absorb data across thousands
of active projects to provide portfolio-wide key metrics, trends and actionable insights.

And third is image manipulation, auto generation of video captions and image descriptions. Brandfolder
can auto generate image descriptions and video captions and detect various elements within an image.
This makes for easy natural language searches and also allows users to separate foreground and
background elements to remove or replace them. Brandfolder will be able to come terabytes of customerspecific content to bring customers high-value capabilities that train AI models and generate content that
is unique to their brand.

As our customers experience the value of our Gen AI features, we intend to pursue multiple monetization
avenues. Our premium features will serve as a catalyst to compel customers to consider moving to
a higher tier of licensing. For these premium Gen AI capabilities, we plan to provide a base tier of
consumption beyond which greater volumes can also be purchased.

Additionally, we see this as a mechanism to drive user licensing as some AI features will be only available
for licensed users. Select customers will be invited to experience our Gen AI features in beta next month
with broader enrollment planned after our customer conference in September. While we have not built any
material contributions from Gen AI into guidance for this fiscal year, we do anticipate additional revenue
opportunities in FY '25.

In closing, as a company approaching $1 billion in ARR, we are optimistic about fiscal year 2024 and
beyond. As the leader in enterprise collaborative work management, we will continue to thoughtfully
invest in our platform, go-to-market initiatives and Gen AI to capitalize on the sizable market opportunity
in front of us. Now let me turn the call over to Pete. Pete?

**Pete Godbole**

_CFO & Treasurer_

Thank you, Mark. As Mark mentioned, we excluded our Q1 revenue guidance and delivered Q1 non-GAAP
operating margin of 10%, more than double the high end of our guidance range, showing the strength
of our business model. However, the macro environment remains challenging, the effects of which are
most pronounced in our higher velocity transactional opportunities that are often associated with our SMB
and mid-market customers. We also see the macro impacting the length of sales cycles for our larger
opportunities and the demand environment for our marketing solutions.

Consistent with our approach from previous quarters, we are electing to remain conservative with
respect to our full year guidance. With that said, Mark mentioned a number of areas that would support
our growth this year and beyond, including healthy demand for our capability-based products, our
newly introduced free plan and the self-discovery and usage of capabilities. Additionally, we are making
marketing investments that we expect to generate a contribution in the second half of this year.

I will now go through our financial results for the first quarter. Unless otherwise stated, all references to
our expenses and operating results on a non-GAAP basis and are reconciled to our GAAP results in the
earnings release and presentation that was posted before the call.

First quarter revenue came in at $219.9 million, up 31% year-over-year. Subscription revenue was $206
million, representing year-over-year growth of 33%. Services revenue was $13.9 million, representing
year-over-year growth of 7%. Revenue from capabilities grew 60% year-over-year and made up 33% of
subscription revenue up from 27% of revenue in Q1 of last year.

Turning to billings. First quarter billings came in at $215.5 million, representing year-over-year growth of
20%. Approximately 93% of subscription billings were annual with 4% monthly. Quarterly and semiannual
represented approximately 3% of the total. Multiyear billings represented less than 1% of total billings.

Moving on to our reported metrics. The number of customers with ARR over $50,000 grew 33% year-overyear to 3,343 and the number of customers with ARR over $100,000 grew 42% year-over-year to 1,569.
These customer segments now represent 63% and 49%, respectively, of total ARR. The percentage of our
ARR coming from customers with ARR over $5,000 is now 90%. Next, our domain average ACV grew 18%
year-over-year to $8,520.

We ended the quarter with a dollar-based net retention rate encompassing all of our customers at 123%.
The full churn rate remains below 4%. We continue to expect our dollar-based net retention rate to trend
lower into the high teens by the end of the year.

Now turning back to the financials. Our total gross margin was 82%. Our Q1 subscription gross margin
was 86%. We expect our gross margin for FY '24 to remain above 80%, Overall operating income in the
quarter was $22.8 million or 10% of revenue, which represents a 6 percentage point sequential margin
improvement.

For modeling purposes, we expect our Q2 and Q3 operating margins to be lower due to the timing of
hiring, incremental marketing campaigns and our ENGAGE conference. We expect the operating margin to
expand sequentially from Q3 to Q4. Free cash flow in the quarter was $31.3 million.

Now let me move on to guidance. For the second quarter of FY '24, we expect revenue to be in the range
of $228 million to $231 million and non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $7 million to $9
million. We expect non-GAAP net income per share to be $0.07 to $0.08 based on diluted weightedaverage shares outstanding of 138.5 million.

For the full fiscal year, we are reiterating our revenue guidance of $943 million to $948 million,
representing growth of 23% to 24%. We expect services to be 6% of total revenue. We expect our nonGAAP operating income to be in the range of $43 million to $53 million, representing an operating margin
of 5% to 6 and non-GAAP net income per share to be $0.37 to $0.44 for the year based on 139 million
diluted weighted-average shares outstanding.


-----

We are reiterating our FY '24 billings growth of 20% and our free cash flow for FY '24 of $110 million. Also
for modeling purposes, we expect our Q2 billings to grow sequentially by around 6% and then accelerate
sequentially from Q2 to Q3 and from Q3 to Q4.
To conclude, we are in the early stages of a large enterprise collaborative work management market
opportunity and investing appropriately to drive top line growth with a focus on efficiency. Our leading
enterprise platform, go-to-market strategy and focused execution, we believe will have a long runway of
sustainable growth and margin expansion ahead. Now let me turn the call over to the operator. Operator?

## Question and Answer
....................................................................................................................................................................

**Operator**

[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question this afternoon from Terry Tillman at Truist Securities.

**Terrell Frederick Tillman**
_Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division_

Great job on the cash flow in the quarter. I guess the first question for you, Mark, is the enterprise
business does seem like it remains strong. I don't know how much we should hang our hat on kind of
$100,000 ACV growth, but it was 42%. So not much from last quarter. Is that a good proxy for the
enterprise business? Do you expect that to stay above 40%? And we didn't get the benchmark on how
many customers over $1 million ACV. Maybe you could help us on that. And then I have a follow-up for
Pete.

**Mark P. Mader**
_President, CEO & Director_

Terry, yes, we did add 1 million customers, we are at 47 right now. In terms of that being a proxy like 40,
the over under on the 40, I would just say we continue to have very good engagement in these larger
opportunities. We added net $85,000 over $100,000 this quarter. And when I look at what customers are
looking for investing in platforms, it maps really well to the enterprise offering right now. They're looking
for both productivity wins for their teams and then how do they climb the curve on things that are of
higher value, and those tie out really well. I talk about these 3 dimensions of work, right, the people, the
content and the work, we have offerings in all 3 of those.

And what I will say is people are really trying to gain a high level of confidence before they make a
buy decision. So as you map to larger opportunities, which are multifaceted, people are asking more
questions, wanting to get more comfort, and that does play out in an elongation, but I see the hand
strengthening in that upper band.

**Terrell Frederick Tillman**
_Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division_

Okay. Duly noted. I guess a follow-up for Pete. You did maintain a 20% billings growth guidance for the
year, and you gave a commentary that I don't think you typically do for each quarter in the progression.
But you called out the higher velocity business being sluggish sales cycle lengthening and then maybe
some of the marketing-related deals getting a bit tougher.

I'm just trying to understand the puts and takes in terms of level of conservatism in the 20% because
those sound like things, I don't know if they're incrementally tougher dynamics that you called out. But
then you have the free plan, you have the discovery dynamics starting at the end of 2Q. Just trying to
understand how much kind of battle tested that 20%. Is it more conservative now? Is it about where it
was? Just a little bit more on kind of risk mitigating the 20% billing.

**Pete Godbole**
_CFO & Treasurer_

So Terry, the 2 parts of your question are, one about how we set the guide. It's a composite on sort of
what I saw in Q1, which there was some softness relative to our expectations, and I called out those
areas for you. Our high-velocity transactional business typically associated with our SMB and midmarket customers. You'll remember the same thing happened during COVID. When COVID hit us, so that
transactional business was an impact area.

We've seen the rest of our business perform according to our expectation, which was based on what I
call the macro that we expected to have worsened. What we did see is the lengthening of sales cycles.
And what that means is when you think of that, that means more of our opportunities pushed into the


-----

back half of the year, and that's consistent with the type of customers we work with, which are enterprise
customers, which have generally more back-end loaded budgets. So that's the reason why we've sort of
given you the guide that says we're maintaining our guide on billings, but it is the composite of those 2
effects and the timing of when deals happen.

**Operator**

We'll go next now to Scott Berg at Needham.

**Scott Randolph Berg**
_Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division_

Congrats on the quarter. I guess as a follow-up to Terry's last question there and Pete your answer. As
enterprise software companies get larger and sell more to the enterprise, we typically see their businesses
more seasonally weighted towards the back half of the year. Do you think this is a 1-year phenomenon
or something that you see maybe more consistently going forward with these larger deals having that
disposition in the second half of the year?

**Pete Godbole**
_CFO & Treasurer_

So Scott, you're going to see that in the enterprise, we'll continue to get more back-end loaded because
that's the nature of enterprise budgets and enterprise cycles. But what you have to do is you have to
overlay on that, how the macro for a year plays out. A lot of companies are taking the approach of
slanting their own budgets to be more back-end loaded. So you're going to find that weight changes a
little bit in how what I call companies are operating in the macro they're in.

**Scott Randolph Berg**
_Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division_

Got it. Helpful. And then, Mark, you spoke pretty positively on the traction within your recently released
free plan, getting conversions across every customer segment I guess, how should we think about that
opportunity contributing to bookings or billings this year? Is this going to be a material driver for you? Or
is this really about kind of seeding this opportunity, and driving better opportunities into fiscal '25?

**Mark P. Mader**
_President, CEO & Director_

Scott, I think it's a really important what I call sort of a seeding exercise. When I think of -- where many
of our new customers click in, it's at a fairly low level of contribution. But what was a really pleasant
surprise was as we launched this in a targeted region in the second half of last year, we were surprised
to see that a meaningful percentage, like north of 1/3 of all organizations that were trialing free and
operating in a free environment where companies over 10,000 employees in size. I mean, I wouldn't have
not placed that bet going into this. That is a really encouraging step.

The second piece, which is encouraging that the conversion rate of organizations who are in free exceeds
the rate of conversion to paid than folks converting from trial. So we've unlocked this opportunity if there's
a population of companies and people who want to be in the platform longer before making that decision.
Seeing that rate higher than our trial conversion rate, very encouraging. And there are thousands of
people coming and joining every single week here. We're talking hundreds of new logos that were added
as paid customers in the last couple of months who otherwise wouldn't be with us today.

So again, on a contribution like new bookings contribution, very small, like rounding air but we know how
it works, right? You get a 10,000 employee customer contributing a little bit, look 5 years down the road,
they're a multimillion-dollar customer. So that is really encouraging. So again, as we focus -- and I've
talked about this in the past earnings calls, we focus on excellence at the enterprise, it's paired with how
do you lower the leading edge. And I think those will play out very well against each other over time.

**Operator**


-----

We will go next now to Brent Thill at Jefferies.

**Sang-Jin Byun**
_Jefferies LLC, Research Division_

This is John Byun on behalf of Brent Thill. May be 2 quick ones related to the environment. I wonder if
you could share some more color on the linearity during the quarter, how things progressed in either in
the activity of billings and how it looks so far, 5, 6 weeks into Q2? And any color on verticals would be
interesting.

**Pete Godbole**
_CFO & Treasurer_

So the way the quarter shaped out for us is it was significant contributions from our second and third
months. It's sort of built up as we went through it. The close rates followed the seasonal patterns we
have seen from the previous quarter. So you were seeing the close rates sort of manifest themselves as
we went and improve as we went through the quarter. And what we've seen for May is May looks very
much like February in terms of close rates, the pipeline is higher, but we're seeing the same sort of deal
dynamics, whether it's associated deal cycle elongation, deal compression. All of those are very much the
same as they were in February, probably a tad bit worse.

**Operator**

We'll go next now to John DiFucci at Guggenheim.

**John Stephen DiFucci**
_Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division_

I have a question for Mark and then a follow-up for Pete. Mark, you're obviously seeing some effects on
your business from the macro backdrop. It's just about everybody is. But your business held up better for
longer than others, at least from our calculations, it did.

When you speak with customers, are you hearing anything different this quarter from previous quarter.
Pete talked a little bit about elongated sales cycles for the enterprise. But anything more? And are there
any differences in the enterprise versus data you have for the SMB or the mid-market?

**Mark P. Mader**
_President, CEO & Director_

I think 1 of the things -- John, one of the things that's worked well for us this past quarter. A couple of
examples I shared during my remarks was evidence of companies looking to try and get more workloads
over to Smartsheet. So we had 1 big travel company that was able to retire a different marketing system
in favor of Smartsheet. So I think they view that as a double win, right? We get an app that our team is
asking for. We're also able to consolidate, that's favorable for us.

The themes haven't really changed, though. People are looking to make the bigger the investment
decision, the more confidence they want to have and the more they wanted to tie up to quantitative
factors. So to what degree can you articulate the return on the dollar spend beyond a qualitative
factor, like we like the app or we feel more productive. I would say, it's maybe gotten a little bit more
pronounced, but I wouldn't say a major deviation or change from the recent 2 quarters.

**John Stephen DiFucci**
_Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division_

Okay. Okay. And Pete, I'm going to go back -- I'm going to let other people ask the billings question
because that's the 1 big question and a couple. But I'm going to ask something else. Free cash flow was
really strong this quarter, especially in your case, it's interesting, right, because you're not a mature
company. You're still growing a lot. There's a lot of opportunity and you're still increasing your scale. So
how much of that growth or that strength in free cash flow has to do with just the leverage in the software


-----

model which we've talked about before is wonderful versus active management of the business against
sort of a tough macro backdrop. Can you sort of gauge that.

**Pete Godbole**
_CFO & Treasurer_

Yes. I would say that the first factor, which is the natural scale in the model is coming through. I think it's
coming through loud and clear as you look at the ability to generate cash. We provided a guide for the full
year at $110 million. As you recall, that was up from, call it, sub-$10 million in the previous year.

So there's natural scale in the model is playing through. We are making improvements in how we come
up with that number outside the scale by being efficient. So when we talk about reducing our operating
expense for things which are not directly tied to revenue and making operations more streamlined using
locations other than the expensive high-cost locations we have, that's the part of it. I would say both are
significant contributors with the business model is probably the predominant one.

**Operator**

We'll go next now to Ryan MacWilliams at Barclays.

**Ryan Patrick MacWilliams**
_Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division_

I know it's still early days on generative AI, and I appreciate your early thoughts on how generative
AI could be added to your platform and the pricing. But any early thoughts around how you could add
generative AI or ChatGPT to some of your capability-based offerings.

**Mark P. Mader**
_President, CEO & Director_

Yes. I think one of the things that I spoke to in the remarks was how this analytics AI component that
we're going to be releasing shortly, how that plays with control center, which is really the crown jewel of
our capabilities offering. So the control center is all about aggregating and scaling programs and projects.

So the data sets are usually very large, very often consistent, someone who's trying to replicate a
program broadly, and to understand the value of those programs, people build dashboards, they generate
widgets, they ask questions against the data sets. And what's really promising about this 1 offering is that
it dramatically drives down the cost of analysis.

So I talked about hundreds of thousands of people building dashboards and widgets. Today, you need to
understand how to build a dashboard, how to create a widget, how to add trend, how to style it all those
things, you get to now ask a question. So if I reduce the cost of your question by 95%, I guarantee you
will ask more questions. You will probably be more successful. You will look better internally, and you'll
probably get a budget next time you ask for it.

So this is like -- it's 1 of these huge accelerants. When I saw this recently developed by our engineering
team, I asked the question, could I ask a question that you hadn't prepared for this demo? They said
sure, fire away. So I asked the question that within 10 seconds, my set of charts with the trend, with
the specific filters applied was automatically done. That will play really well with customers. So we know
there's a lot of intent already to want to answer these questions. When you pair that with an enabling
technology that's easily understood, it doesn't require a lot of sales oversight or customer success
oversight.

So we will launch this with some beta customers next month ramping to our customer Engage conference.
And I really believe when people see the return that it can provide, I think there will be a very significant
appetite. So that's probably the 1 that's most clear. The other piece is around the assistant when I think
of 40% of all of our cases that come into our company, being around advanced configuration unlocking
greater value on the things that are unique to Smartsheet in terms of what we can pull off from a
calculation standpoint, the round trip time on support will fall significantly.


-----

And the benefit to us, call deflection, the benefit of the customer in terms of getting your question
answered quickly and correctly. Those are really big deals. So it's difficult to quantify the benefit or the
revenue opportunity for us thus far. But there's no confusion about whether this will add value.

**Ryan Patrick MacWilliams**
_Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division_

I agree. I think driving that knowledge worker productivity definitely accrues the software and efficiency.
Just one for Pete, Were there any deals that slipped out of 1Q and close in 2Q? And any early signs of
stabilization within the higher velocity transaction opportunities you talked about?

**Pete Godbole**
_CFO & Treasurer_

So first of all, we always have to use the slip in the quarter to the next quarter. We've had consistent close
rates on those deals. So the close rate is sort of staying consistent. And as far as the other pieces -- other
part of your question, which is -- are we seeing any trends emerge, there's nothing that's unusual.

**Operator**

We'll go next now to George Iwanyc at Oppenheimer.

**George Michael Iwanyc**
_Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division_

Pete, maybe could you give us some perspective on sales productivity with the challenges you're seeing in
the macro environment? How are you responding from a sales perspective?

**Pete Godbole**
_CFO & Treasurer_

So George, when we looked at sales productivity, as you look at the environment, we're seeing the sales
productivity be reflected in that number.

So we're seeing the productivity obviously decline as the macro impacts people's ability to close business.
What we are finding is our sales teams are generating opportunity at a brisk pace, including sometimes
faster than earlier quarters. So pipeline builds are working. It's a close rate in the macro that's driving
sales productivity lower than prior quarters.

**George Michael Iwanyc**
_Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division_

All right. And then maybe you can build in on the marketing effort that you're planning for the second half
of the year. Are those some new direct marketing efforts this something with the ecosystem that you're
planning at partners?

**Pete Godbole**
_CFO & Treasurer_

So George, we are launching incremental marketing programs to drive to sort of what I call high-value
conversions and that is incremental to what we've done. So that should reflect itself in second half
bookings. We're doing that on the back of sort of very predictable cohorts that we've seen materialize
with an approach that we've sort of been working on for the last quarter, which gives us confidence in our
second half guide that we provided as well.

**Operator**

Thank you. We go next now to Michael Berg at Wells Fargo.

**Michael H. Berg**
_Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division_


-----

Piggybacking off the margin, how can we think about any change in conservatism or assumptions baked
into the margin guidance? Then I got a follow-up.

**Pete Godbole**
_CFO & Treasurer_

So I think our margin guidance appropriately considers the investments we would like to make as well as
our overall guide for the year. We feel confident with the $43 million to $53 million op margin guide we've
provided, we raised it from the $35 million to $45 million, which was there before, and we feel good about
it.

I think some of this is going to be about -- it's early in the year. And as the year progresses, we'll be
making real-time decisions on sort of how we invest while maintaining our guidance that we have at 43
million to 53 million.

**Michael H. Berg**
_Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division_

And then the quick follow-up to that is you mentioned that part of the outperformance on margins in the
quarter was due to hiring. I guess, a, where are you on sales ramp or net new quota-carrying rep hiring?
And be given what you're seeing in the macro, are there any changes to that? Or like you just said, that's
going to be more of a real-time decision?

**Pete Godbole**
_CFO & Treasurer_

So our -- we've got some hiring, which is progressing through. It's not a large part of it on the sales side.
We feel good about where we are in capacity. There will be some additions, but it's not anywhere near sort
of where we've added in the last fiscal year. So that's a part of it.

There's positions in R&D and other parts of the organization as well, which we're adding in, which are what
I would call in a smaller nature of investment we're building in. We're not ramping our hiring engine until
we see how the macro looks beyond that.

**Operator**

We'll go next now to Alex Zukin at Wolfe Research.

**Ethan Bruck**

This is Ethan Bruck on for Al Zukin. I guess 2 quick ones. One, just help explain some of the discrepancy
between taking up the op margin guide and leaving the cash flow unchanged for the year. Is it just leaving
some room kind of investments?

And then I guess the other one is just, are you seeing kind of just kind of update from the free stuff or the
free offering as kind of a way, a natural way to shift go-to-market efforts, upmarket enterprise as like a
potential upside to the margin targets for the year?

**Pete Godbole**
_CFO & Treasurer_

So I didn't catch the first part of your question. It looked like you were asking about billings and free cash
flow in the relationship? Did I get you right?

**Ethan Bruck**

In terms of the full year guide, you guys took about margin guide slightly but less free cash flow
unchanged for the year. Is that just a kind of leaving room for it, I guess, to invest in capacity in the back
half if May starts to pick up?

**Pete Godbole**
_CFO & Treasurer_


-----

So the -- you should think of op margin and sort of revenue going together. So -- and you should think
of billings and free cash flow working together. So we haven't changed our billings guide. We haven't
changed our free cash flow guide from what we provided as an estimate. We haven't changed our
revenue, but what we have passed through is the efficiencies we found and which we feel comfortable
with, which we've moved through into the op margin incremental sort of guide we provided.

**Operator**

We go next now to Jacob Roberge at William Blair.

**Jacob Roberge**
_William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division_

Pete, just going back to the billings growth acceleration in the back half of the year, could you talk about
the confidence in that? It seems like it's related to the seasonality of enterprise deals landing in Q4. But
is there anything else in the model that's helping that? And then is there any potential risk that some of
those larger deals get pushed actually out more into fiscal 2025? Or have you accounted for some of that
potential risk within the back half acceleration guide.

**Pete Godbole**
_CFO & Treasurer_

So Jake, essentially, we've looked at the deals, and we've looked at our larger deals. We've looked at
the close rates on those deals. We see those closing. They're just taking longer elongated sales cycle.
So we know the timing of when these deals now come into our ecosystem, if you will. We know that our
customer budgets are heavier in the second half. So marrying the deal elongation and sales cycle with
customer budgets, we feel good about sort of where that number is in terms of how we set the guide. We
always know that there's going to be some level of deal push out that takes place, it's factored into our
guide.

The additional item I mentioned was we've started incremental marketing program investment based on
high LTV customers, with high value and fidelity of return, that's what we've added into the mix as well.
So between those factors, we're pretty comfortable with our guide for FY '24 on the billings and revenue
side of it.

**Jacob Roberge**
_William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division_

Okay. Great. Very helpful. And then could you talk more about the demand that you're seeing in some
of your newer products. Seems like Advance had a pretty solid quarter, but could you just provide
some more color on what's driving demand for that product suite? And then just thinking about the
broader platform, have you seen any solutions get more or less prioritized just given the uncertain macro
environment?

**Pete Godbole**
_CFO & Treasurer_

Yes. So the -- when I think about the products that have gained a lot of traction that I've seen sort of
really resonate well. I think there's 2 layers to it. One is we are seeing Advance. We gave the stats of
143 people either buying Advance or upgrading to a tier in Advance. So you're seeing that play out
where customers are buying packages because they see it as the simplest way to generate value in
an environment, where they know there's proven ROI. So I think we're seeing that with our largest
customers. We're also seeing traction for individual capabilities. In this current environment people are
taking the approach of buying by the drink by the individual capability. And we know that's fine because a
lot of these customers start by buying 1 capability, but it sets them on this seeded journey to buy Advance
eventually or buy more capabilities eventually. So we're seeing that play out pretty well.

I think in general, we've seen great traction with some of our capabilities like data shuttles. So we've seen
sort of what I call great demand for some part of our product portfolio, which we called out here.

**Operator**

We go next now is to Shebly Seyrafi at FBN Securities.

**Shebly Seyrafi**
_FBN Securities, Inc., Research Division_

So you beat your fiscal Q1 revenue guidance by about $6 million, and you're guiding pretty much in line
with consensus in fiscal Q2 for revenue. And yet you kept your annual revenue range unchanged at $9.43,
$9.48. So implicitly, you might be lowering your expectation by $6 million in the back half. Is that the right
way to look at it?

**Pete Godbole**
_CFO & Treasurer_

So what we've done is our approach to guidance over the last several quarters has been to be
conservative sort of given the macro we're in. The macros are dynamic for us. So given this macro, we're
still early in the year, we've elected to remain conservative as we thought of guidance. So that's why we
haven't changed the guide for the year despite the overperformance in Q1.

**Shebly Seyrafi**
_FBN Securities, Inc., Research Division_

Okay. And any international call-outs?

**Pete Godbole**
_CFO & Treasurer_

I think we were sort of -- the performance that we had in international was according to our expectations.
Obviously, there's more of a headwind internationally, and we saw that come through, where it's
completely aligned with what our expectations were for those reasons.

**Operator**

We go next now to see Enders at Citi. And Mr. Anders your line is open, sir, if you have a question. I am
hearing no response. We'll take our next question now from Pinjalim Bora at JPMorgan.

**Pinjalim Bora**
_JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division_

The sales discovery of capabilities is interesting. I wanted to ask you if you're already piloting that with
customers, what are you seeing with that respect? And is there -- is that -- will that also include kind
of ability for the customers to buy the products online on a self-serve basis? Or would that still require
kind of a sales effort as people look to get into Data Shuttle or something else? And then thirdly, are you
modeling some of benefit from this as it goes online in the second half in terms of bookings?

**Mark P. Mader**
_President, CEO & Director_

We have not modeled any uplift from that into the second half. What we're solving for what we're
releasing in July is the discovery and the usage of. So someone in a self-directed way will be able to in
context see these, understand how it applies to what they're trying to do, whether it's in the context
of Advance sharing or Data Shuttle, be able to start using it immediately. It will still engage a member
of our team to take the order, but there will be no friction in the identification it, the utilization of it, et
cetera. And that's a very significant win. We have -- as I shared last time, we have well under 10% of
our customers buying a second product from us. So we think this is the launch point to really get cross
product attached.

**Pinjalim Bora**
_JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division_


-----

Understood. One quick follow-up for Pete. Pete, the deferred revenue, I think, sequentially was down
probably for the first time, at least when I was looking backwards in a while. Is there -- can you kind of
tease out how much is that because of the SMB weakness, the mid-market weakness versus kind of deals
push out because of lumber sales cycles? Any way to understand that?

**Pete Godbole**
_CFO & Treasurer_

The way I would characterize it is the -- the large contributor was the high-velocity transactional business
associated with what I call generally associated with SMB and mid-market. And then the other elements is
it demand for our marketing solutions and the elongation of sales cycle we're probably on SMB, a similar
order of magnitude but next up.

**Operator**

We will go next now to Jackson Ader at SVB MoffetNathanson.

**Kyle Diehl**
_MoffettNathanson LLC_

Great. This is Kyle on for Jackson. I think we talked a lot about the macro, but maybe could you just give
us an update on the competitive environment and maybe how compared to early last year, if you're seeing
anyone more or less and then how win rates are looking? And then I do just have a quick follow-up on just
kind of -- I think, Mark, you may have mentioned that there was an expansion where you guys pushed out
another tool, if there's just maybe a few use cases that you guys have tended to see be the catalyst for
kind of a standardization. That would be great.

**Mark P. Mader**
_President, CEO & Director_

Yes. Over a longer horizon, I'd say, over the last 2 years, we have seen an increase in our conversion rate
or win rate on new. So that has progressed. Again, from a bookings contribution standpoint, those new
wins don't accumulate too much, but they do service that planting of seeds. So that is on pace.

In terms of expansion, once we're in the account, there's not a material change to the frequency with
which we're seeing people. I would say as we continue to improve how the 3 dimensions of work that I
talk about get more deeply integrated the greater the return for a customer is to say, I'm going to go with
Smartsheet for content and work or people and content and work. And I think that does then put a lot of
pressure on those providers who are only delivering on 1 of those dimensions. So it's how do you unify,
how do you simplify? How do you get those economies of scale.

So I think, again, this is at the hand of strengthening on that side. I have not seen anybody in category
make moves to talk about those unifying those 3 dimensions of work within their portfolio through
integrations potentially, but that's very different than having a sole source. So not a lot -- when you look
at where most companies still are today, the leading competitor is the status quo, which is not anybody in
our category today. It's still the #1. And I would expect that to be the case for the next 2 years.

**Operator**

We'll go next now to Jason Celino at KeyBanc Capital Markets.

**Jason Vincent Celino**
_KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division_

Just 2 quick ones from me. So interesting to see the launch of the preplan. I guess, what is the plan to
drive interest in those types of customers. Will that be mostly paid marketing driven? And then second,
can you just elaborate on the opportunity to maybe convert some of these free users to paid users over
time?

**Pete Godbole**
_CFO & Treasurer_


-----

So I'll take the first part of it, which is on the marketing effort to go after it, we've -- as I said, we are
launching marketing programs at the end of last quarter and the beginning of this quarter, which really
go after high-value conversions, high LTV customers. But a part of that marketing demand spills over into
people getting interested in the free plan. It's not our focus in going after it, but it naturally helps the free
plan. The rest of it comes from people discovering those free plans as they look for ways to solve their
collaborative work management problem, which really drives this process into high gear. Mark, over to you
for the second part.

**Mark P. Mader**
_President, CEO & Director_

Yes. And then in terms of the tactics to get an ENGAGE population in free to spend first dollar with you,
you have the full portfolio available to us. As we start getting our self-discovered feature set introduced to
people, as we start to deploy Gen AI experiences, we get to make those choices in terms of what we want
to put in front of somebody. The good news is that we are already seeing a higher -- disproportionately
higher conversion rates to paid from that population. And as you allow them to experience some of these
premium things, some of these innovative elements, I would expect that to be a continued tailwind to
getting those people on side.

So it's an ever-growing population. We're adding a lot of companies to this realm. And we'll be watching
that conversion rate closely as we introduce some of these new capabilities.

**Operator**

We will go next now to Josh Baer at Morgan Stanley.

**Joshua Phillip Baer**
_Morgan Stanley, Research Division_

Mark, I think you gave a great overview of some of the areas that you're intending to release AI
capabilities and the ways that you should be able to monetize. I was hoping you could do 2 things. From
the customer perspective, could you talk a little bit more about how your conversations with customers
are evolving around AI? Are they looking to you to help bring AI into the organization? Is this something
that they're actively engaging around from a timeline perspective?

And then second, I think it sounds like those 3 areas of Gen AI are relatively near-term initiatives. Just
hoping you could sort of help with our imagination thinking about your platform, the data you have and
like the longer-term potential for additional AI use cases or AI outside of those 3 main buckets that you
outlined so far.

**Mark P. Mader**
_President, CEO & Director_

Yes. We serve such a diverse set of companies ranging from manufacturing to education to health to
technology to services providers. And I would say that the AI conversations are as diverse. It's ranging
from the very inquisitive, well-informed prospect or customer who wants to go deep on the topic to the
other end of the spectrum, which is can you just give me the basic education on what it means? Is it safe?
How will you be secure and responsible in terms of how you're applying AI to your realm. Does my data
leave your boundary? Does it get shipped off to some service providers to improve their model like how
does it work? And I think there's a really good opportunity right now to become a trusted adviser.

So as we talk about our advanced analytics that we're flipping on for people, we focus on the fact that we
get to take advantage of open AI, we get to take advantage of these large language models. We get to
take advantage of having their data not leave our boundary. That's a huge deal.

So as we think about this opportunity to educate, become the trusted adviser and to have them look at us
being able to say, Smartsheet is a mechanism for us to apply AI to our operations safely and securely, like
that's something that they're having to report out internally to their stakeholders. So I think we can play a
very active role in that.


-----

I think there are various phases of the game on the AI piece. One of it -- and I look at sort of the
customer in, someone starting out with us, trying to get educated, trying to unlock the potential, see how
they can maximize the value all the way up to the highly sophisticated, fully enabled control center person
deploying a 2,000 wind turbine farm, very advanced situation.

And I think what our duty is to be able to help someone at every phase of that journey. And I think it's
very different using AI to help someone convert to paid for the first time versus the person trying to add
another 7 figures of ARR contribution to us. And when I think of the long-term opportunity for us, it's -how do you not only provide the convenience of AI to help them move more quickly, but how do you allow
them to capitalize on the data set that's already been stored with you in some cases for years. How do you
unlock insights in it.

And again, that is more pertinent to someone who's been with you for a long time. But our model is so
well set up because we have a clear understanding of intent. So if you were an ad hoc model that allowed
people to collaborate in a fully unstructured way, that's fine. We happen to be the huge beneficiaries of
knowing exactly what our customers are trying to do.

Their data models describe their intent, their interaction gives us insight into who's pertinent and who's
most relevant. We get to use all of that on their behalf to apply AI to it. And I think the -- we look at AI in
2 ways also. One is very much inwardly what can we do within our ecosystem and then what can we do as
a partner with other ecosystems.

So when you look about what Microsoft announced a build, how do you use -- how do you co-op a
Microsoft Teams co-pilot infused experience with the tooling we already have to align with Teams. So
it's not just how do you apply AI to maximize the Smartsheet feature set, how do you apply it to get
maximum utility out of the other enterprise platforms they have today. And I think customers are looking
for coaching on both fronts.

So much of our growth over the years has been coming in with an informed point of view and then
listening very intently to what customers want. And I think our AI strategy that we've built so far
is absolutely influenced by what our customers are doing, the assistant, the analytics, the content
generation, it's all predicated on where we see activity today. And as we deploy this, we're going to get
a lot smarter about where people's sensitivities are, where their needs are. And I think that strategy will
emerge very, very clearly as we enter next year.

**Operator**

We go next now to Keith Bachman at BMO.

**Keith Frances Bachman**
_BMO Capital Markets Equity Research_

Sorry, I do want to go back to the billings guide because I'm a little confused. You used a couple of
times in the discussion this evening the word conservatism that you usually approach guidance with
conservatism. But I think you said that you thought billings would grow by 6% sequentially in July quarter
and perhaps I misunderstood that, but that implies something like 11% to 12% year-over-year billings
growth. And it puts a lot of pressure on the back half of the year to get to something even close to 20%
billings growth.

And so the first part of the question is, when you say back half of the year, do you mean both the October
and Jan quarter, or are you really sort of pushing everything to the Jan quarter? And then secondly, just
-- when you say you're being conservative on your guidance, and I think to be fair, the previous question
was related to revenue, but it doesn't seem like you're being conservative on this billings guidance. So
maybe just help me understand a little bit.

**Pete Godbole**
_CFO & Treasurer_


-----

So Keith, I'll first confirm the question you asked in terms of what you're sort of calculating. We did give
you a sort of a steer and sort of how we would think of modeling Q2, which was a 6% sequential increase.
I think when you look at that number and you say, how does that come about? And what gives you the
confidence in the back half.

There's 2 elements I pointed to, which are specific. One, we have an elongation of the sales cycle, but
the deals close and we see their closing. We see that we know that the enterprise budgets, as we looked
at customers and evaluated what they have, our setup for the back half sort of expenditure rate, which
is consistent with enterprises. So our elongated sales cycles, timing of when they close intersecting with
customer budgets is something we've seen fairly well, and that's what's sort of giving us the confidence
across both Q3 and Q4. So we've sort of built that in. That's one.

The second part of it is we've made incremental and significant investments in marketing programs, which
are based on high LTV customers that provide high value. So we know that those dollars convert with
fidelity to what we expect our bookings for -- booking contributions for the second half. That's the way we
built it in. I think our what you call, our guidance is -- on billings is thoughtful and we've sort of considered
the macro and how we expect that to evolve as well.

**Keith Frances Bachman**
_BMO Capital Markets Equity Research_

All right. Just to -- again, sorry, I got to tease this out, but many companies would suggest that if you
have billing -- excuse me, deal elongation that's going to continue such that there's just frankly, slippage
through the out the year. Are you assuming that there's some -- there's an improved close rate, so to
speak, as you get towards the end of the year that's facilitating getting to 20 and/or an improvement in
the macro?

**Pete Godbole**
_CFO & Treasurer_

We're not factoring an improvement in the macro. We're assuming on the longer deal cycles with
enterprise budgets, our close rates do improve as you think those. So that's a key part of the sort of how
we are thinking of the guide. And then the other part, Keith, you've got to remember we're dealing with
the macro where the comps get much easier as you go into Q3 and Q4. So when you look at Q3 and Q4
and you look at the growth rate and billings, you're doing it for a comp with macro already started to
manifest itself in our results last year. So between those 2, I think we feel good about sort of how the year
plays out.

**Keith Frances Bachman**
_BMO Capital Markets Equity Research_

Okay. I submit that the comps are easier, certainly in Q4, but it's a relatively hard compare in Q3 as well,
but I will see the floor.

**Operator**

We go next now to Robert Simmons at D.A. Davidson.

**Robert Edward Simmons**
_D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division_

So you guys have been going a bit into your partner ecosystem. Can you update us on how that's going?
How much of your new business is actually driven or influenced by it?

**Pete Godbole**
_CFO & Treasurer_

So the partners are a key part of sort of how we go to market because they bring unique capability in
markets like international, they play an integral part in co-selling with us. Our percentage of what I call


-----

partner-touched revenue, has increased from Q1 of last year to Q1 of this year, and it's now sitting in the
mid-teens in terms of sort of how we think of that contribution.

**Mark P. Mader**
_President, CEO & Director_

In terms of the reliance on third parties to bring us business where it's really partner-led entirely, that's
a small minority of the business today. Where they have proven quite helpful is in that co-selling, as Pete
said. So I think you asked specifically about them bringing us business. I would say it's -- that has been
substantially less than 15% of our total, but still very helpful to have their participation.

**Robert Edward Simmons**
_D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division_

Got it. And then what do you see in terms of like the big SIs building out their practices? Is that
progressing to plan? Or are you going to color there would be helpful?

**Mark P. Mader**
_President, CEO & Director_

Yes. We anticipate having some news on that in the second half. As I reported out last quarter, we have a
number of the global SIs who have built practice areas in Smartsheet. And it's -- when I compare that to
the large SIs who are doing exclusively system implementation and config on behalf of clients.

What's interesting about 2 of the large ones that we're working with right now is that they're actually
building service delivery practices on Smartsheet. And then after they've concluded whether it's on an
accounting dimension or on an M&A or divestiture dimension, Smartsheet is left behind to help their
clients operate. So it's very different than being hired to do a system implementation on some -- on behalf
of the customer. It's really them delivering their services and leaving Smartsheet with the customer post
project. We'll have more to report on that in the second half.

**Operator**

We'll take our final question today from Fred Lee of Crédit Suisse.

**Frederick Lee**
_Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division_

Nice work on the profitability side of the health and also on free cash generation. I have a question with
regard to the introduction of free and the potential impact to the existing install base in that with weaker
macro, what we've seen are some customers at other software companies electing to actually downgrade
to free in the near term. How do you protect against this? And because this could potentially elevate risk
to the base of the pyramid.

**Mark P. Mader**
_President, CEO & Director_

Yes. When we initiated free last year, we did a lot of design work on this, and we were very prudent, I
would say, in our approach to what free provides somebody. While you can use our different views and our
dashboards and elements of automation, the constraint is put in, in terms of who you can share your work
with. When we look at the sharing need within our organizations, our customers, it's significant.

And it can give you a good taste today. You can share it with up to 2 people, but we have -- we obviously
had a lot of work in the quarters leading up to launching it globally to understand the impact. We saw no
impact to our conversion to our paying plans and we see no evidence of people downgrading to free at our
paid customers today of any significance.

And that was a key part of our research before we launched it globally. And again, we've seen nothing
different since launching it globally from what we saw in those quarters running up.

**Frederick Lee**


-----

_Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division_

Got it. That's extremely helpful. And then just a quick 1 for Pete. Last quarter, you said NR would end in
the high teens towards the end of the year. And I might have missed it, but did you give an update here.
And then if you could talk a little bit on pricing or whether it's been stable, if there's been any degradation
sequentially from Q4.

**Pete Godbole**
_CFO & Treasurer_

So I think we -- in my prepared remarks, said we expect the net dollar retention rate to end the year in
the high teens. So we sort of reiterated what we'd said before. So we set that out. Now are we seeing any
price degradation in the market? I think we're seeing our prices all we're seeing demand vectors of what I
call the high-velocity business where people just decide they're not going to go for the quick project that
you can start and sort of go down with right away within a short period of time. That's what we're seeing.
We're not seeing a giant price degradation happening.
