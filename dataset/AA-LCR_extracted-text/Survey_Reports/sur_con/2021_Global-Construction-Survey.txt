# Resilience

##### Paradigm shift opportunity


-----

The engineering and construction industry is accustomed to coping with
disruption. Whether it’s macroeconomic and financial cycles, natural and manmade disasters, or increasingly varying and impactful weather conditions, the
sector routinely overcomes design, schedule and budget changes, supply
delays, equipment failure, labor disputes and accidents.

And so it was with COVID-19, where all over the world, projects continued
in the face of remote working, lower workforce numbers allowed onsite, and
illness. Although just 36 percent of respondents say they were ‘well prepared’
for the pandemic, the vast majority feel they were able to respond quickly and
decisively recover (Figure 1).

Rebalancing contract risk


For many years now the sector has been looking at ways
to break the cycle of at-risk, lump-sum contracts. These
‘bet the farm’ projects carry a significant risk imbalance
weighted heavily in favor of owners, placing existential
pressure on contractors. All it takes is for one contractor to
accept such a burden, and others follow suit in a vicious
cycle. Recently, however, for complex, multi-year, megaprojects, contractors have been shifting to hybrid or costplus arrangements with lower liability for cost and schedule
overruns.

Consequently, project owners, faced with a shared
responsibility for risks, are now taking greater interest


in controls over scoping, budgeting, and planning, and
investing in risk management to support their capital
investment decisions.

The pandemic accelerated the risk transfer away from
contractors and also saw an unusually high level of
cooperation, to cope with the increased impacts on
cost and schedule. Owners were largely appreciative
of the challenges—most notably the health and safety
restrictions—and, as our survey suggests, appeared
willing to absorb a higher proportion of cost overruns;
consequently respondents from owner organizations were
considerably more likely to suffer excess costs (Figure 2).

The sudden COVID-19 lock downs, experienced in
countries around the world, has forced companies’ hands
in improving communications and connectivity, to keep
projects running while adhering to far stricter health and
safety criteria. Having enjoyed the dramatic improvements
from remote working and digital collaboration, 50 percent
of engineering and construction firms (and 33 percent
of project owners) plan to build on this with significant
investment in technologies designed to enhance their
delivery of capital programs (Figure 16, page 33).


Other factors driving resilience are strong company
leadership, diversity of regional operations, business
continuity planning, and innovation. When asked how they
could improve their resilience, respondents cite financial
management, risk management, and labor/resource
management as the top three areas of focus, along with
supply chain and governance.

Recognizing resilience as a
core capability


The engineering and construction sector has started to
recognize that it’s not enough to simply respond effectively
to shocks, and that resilience must be operationalized and
treated as a key strength.


A large majority of respondents (87 percent) say it’s very
or quite important to plan for resilience in capital projects/
programs (Figure 4), while an even larger proportion are
committing resources to achieve this goal (Figure 5).

KPMG thinks:

**Adapting to permanent disruption could increase efficiency**


In many respects, the sector responded admirably to the
challenges of COVID-19. Owners tended to acknowledge
the unforeseen pressures on contractors and frequently
compensated them for delays. The move away from
imbalanced, fixed-price contracts feels like a re-balancing
of risk after too many years of contractors suffering huge
losses, which in some cases pushed companies into
liquidation—with inevitable knock-on effects for owners
who saw projects stalled. Hopefully this will signal a more
collaborative approach to risk sharing that should benefit
all players, with risks allocated to those most equipped to
manage them. It would be unfortunate if over-competitive
bidding once again saw contractors saddled with burdens
that they couldn’t live up to.

The pandemic also meant that contractors had to work in
different and smarter ways, speeding up the adoption of
innovative technologies like video communications, cloudshared files and walk-throughs by drones. This has been a
game changer for efficiency, enabling project managers to
communicate remotely, change plans in real time and track
people on site, enabling projects to proceed at pace. It


feels like we’re embracing a new breed of agile specialists
working anytime from anywhere.

As vaccines are rolled out, the pandemic appears to be
slowing in many parts of the world, but that doesn’t mean
that other emerging risks won’t surface. Both owners and
contractors will have to plan for continued horizontal and
vertical integration of the construction supply chain in the
form of business consolidation and reorganization. These
changes are driven by improved productivity (a result of
technology integration) and shifts in regional demand
for construction services. Industry leaders will continue
to integrate diversity and inclusion into recruitment and
training, changing patterns of government infrastructure
investment, new social policies and regulatory changes,
and rising investor demands for higher environmental,
social and governance (ESG) standards.

Such challenges can only be met by a strong focus on
assessing, prioritizing and responding to risks, and a full
understanding of the impact of future disruption on the
workforce, the operations, costs, revenue and reputation.

**View from the industry**

Integrated project delivery is a concept that’s coming
of age. As an owner, we have seconded our people
to the vendor, with a ‘one team’ concept, to make
them and us more successful. Now we can go into to
a room and talk to project managers or construction
managers, and I honestly don’t know which company
they work for. This approach could work for any of our
vendors and it really speeds up the project. The lesson
here is to integrate and work together, with more
transparency.

The digital and technological environment around us
is forcing change more rapidly. We can’t continue as
we are. Highways England is taking the opportunity
to consider how best we contract with our supply
chain partners and get serious about an integrated
approach. This is about our operating model: how we
better understand the supply chain at every level in
order to extract value, and how we influence suppliers
to invest in digital adaption and drive innovation.

We must ensure that our partners get plenty of
opportunity and that we are working seamlessly with
them through our commercial models. We can’t just
wish things to be true. We work and partner with
private sector organizations and we must help them
shape their investment and change towards the new

# Integrated risk management

##### A joined-up view of risk


-----

In the very first KPMG Global Construction Survey in 2005, a majority of
respondents cited ‘managing risk’ as one of their top three challenges.
COVID-19 is just the latest in a series of ‘black swan’ events over the past
decades, and once more the engineering and construction industry has
struggled to manage the complexities at both enterprise and project level. More
than one-third (37 percent) of respondents say their companies missed budget
and/or scheduled performance targets (by a factor of 20 percent or more) as a
result of COVID-19 (Figure 2, page 7).

Not surprisingly then, risk management is considered one of the most critical
areas to address in order to improve organizational resilience. There’s a
particular desire to achieve a more holistic view of risks, with 60 percent
acknowledging the need to increase integration and visibility between enterprise
risk management, portfolio risk management and project risk management
functions (Figure 6).

Risk management game-changers


The engineering and construction executives taking part
in this year’s survey are determined to improve their
organizational risk management and recognize the need to
get the ‘basics’ right. Clear and standardized risk processes
and controls are the top priority, along with a risk culture
and accurate risk reporting (Figure 8, page 15). Risk
management across the sector can vary widely in quality
and these elements are table stakes.


Relatively few respondents (27 percent) consider
quantitative risk analysis tools as important, which could
turn out to be an oversight, as boards increasingly expect
to see more detailed analysis of the financial impact of
events. These tools have tremendous potential, but the
relatively low adoption may signal a wider lack of trust in
the underlying data, which can undermine the ability to
develop reliable, accurate risk analyses.

Risk processes and controls are only as good as the
people that operate them. In the same way that the
sector has made safety second nature, companies must
embed risk management into their DNA. Forty percent
of respondents say their organizations are committed to
creating a clearly defined risk culture, where people feel
comfortable voicing concerns and raising challenges. This
can only work if the messages from the top are aligned
and consistent, with leaders seen to be taking firm action
to address any failings. Having the right tone at the top and
consistent communication and reinforcement throughout
the organization is critical.


However, it appears that risk management has some way
to go before it’s treated as seriously as other functions.
Only a small proportion feel their organization needs a
board-level risk management committee and/or a separate
risk department, while formal risk management training is
also lacking—for both owners and contractors.

Which is why integrated risk management is such a big
deal. Yet at present, a mere 34 percent (Figure 9) say their
organization has a joined-up ethos that encompasses
enterprise, portfolio and project risk management. Without
integration, it’s hard, if not impossible, to work out the
impact of different events and phenomena.

KPMG thinks:

**Understanding the interconnectedness of risks**

As a sector, engineering and construction has some way to go in developing
sophisticated and holistic risk management practices. Standards vary widely
between different companies and between different project owners’ industries.

An independent risk function would be an excellent step forward. Currently it’s
hard to take a high-level, cross-enterprise view of risks in projects, procurement,
supply chain, markets, contracts and finance. For instance, a project team
tends to focus on construction risk, but also has line of sight into other risks
including supply chain, IT and operations—and may be aware of other risks.
Yet, there may be no process to capture or disseminate this critical information.
Similarly, a risk in one region could affect the wider organization, but may go
unnoticed if risk management is not managed centrally and integrated across
the organization.

With a complete, transparent and real-time view across all regions, business
units and projects, it may transpire that the organization is facing a larger—and
possibly unsustainable—level of portfolio risk than it had imagined, which would
influence decisions to take on new projects. It’s especially challenging for project
owners, who may not be able to see what’s happening with operators and
contractors and may not receive data for days or even months.


-----

**View from the industry**

There’s a need to take enterprise risks more seriously, to get good linkage between project level activities,
business units and regions. Find ways to capture and categorize risk items to roll up to enterprise level, to
make sure that what you do operationally aligns with strategy, from an enterprise risk appetite and management
perspective. This means having bigger conversations at the board table than used to happen.

**Jon Nield,**
_Chief Executive Officer,_
_Engineering & Construction Risk Institute_


**View from the industry**

You must collect a whole lot of data on project risk, categorize it, prioritize it, quantify it, and be very process driven,
to aggregate risk and assess what it means for the entire enterprise. Much of this is regularly done at the project-
level. For example: projects already address hazardous materials, so why not compile all project information as it
relates to hazardous materials—along with proven mitigation strategies. Another example is local resources. Some
countries require local labor, which brings a substantial risk to productivity if you can’t access this resource. Out of
necessity, projects mitigate this risk by developing local resources resulting in a social benefit to the workforce and
community. We should capture and process this available project information to recognize how the enterprise may
deliver on ESG objectives through its regular course of business.

# Portfolio project management

##### The impossible job?


-----

Managing a significant portfolio of programs and projects involves juggling a
complex set of criteria to gain maximum value—a task made harder by the size
and complexity of individual mega-projects that can soak up resources and carry
huge risks. Political factors also intervene: in some cases, shiny new initiatives
take precedence over less exciting but important maintenance projects. A wellrun portfolio aligns project decisions with organizational strategy and aims to
optimize return on investment.

The responses from this year’s survey indicate that owners have more mature
portfolio management than contractors (Figure 10, page 20), with the larger
organizations the most advanced—which is to be expected given their superior
resources. In our experience, engineering and construction companies are,
however, making progress and, indeed, are ahead in terms of screening
potential projects and employing financial and risk analysis tools—a sign that
they’re no longer willing to undertake any project without regard to margin
or risk. This may also mean that engineering companies and contractors are
becoming increasingly cautious about bidding on very large, highly regulated,
complex, extended duration projects in competitive markets, fearful of repeating
past failures.

Interestingly, respondents from real estate and hospitality companies suggest
that these sectors lag behind others in their portfolio controls. Real estate in
particular is often not the core business of investors, who are more typically
corporations looking to expand into new space, with decisions often driven by
the most powerful business units.

Government, on the other hand, appears to lead the way in its portfolio
management, which suggests a big leap after years of under-investment.
Certainly the approval process in the public sector is typically long and onerous,
although there remains a question mark over how funds are allocated and how
resources are used on actual projects.


-----

Project owners making strides—
but key gaps prevail


More than two-thirds of project owners have defined
portfolio governance processes and an established capital
allocation framework, which lets executives stay abreast of
the overall portfolio direction and performance and ensures


that resources are applied in an optimal fashion
(Figure 10). Healthcare, government, and power and
utilities are the sectors that appear to practice the most
effective allocation of capital.

Source: 2021 Global Construction Survey


One concern is that only four in ten owners say they use
portfolio planning software (Figure 10). With a crisis like
COVID-19, there’s often an urgent need to reallocate
resources, but to do so requires real-time data to do


scenario analyses and figure out how best to shift people,
equipment and money. In an asset-intensive organization,
running multiple projects worth billions of dollars, this
represents a big opportunity to improve performance.


-----

Similarly, 45 percent of owners do not have an embedded
asset management team to oversee capital allocation
between projects (Figure 10). The tension between
competing interests puts pressure on leaders to funnel
resources into certain projects that may be higher profile
or satisfy immediate issues. For instance, in the public
infrastructure sector, we often see expensive new programs
such as new lanes on highways to reduce congestion,
with critical maintenance taking second place. The result?
The immediate needs of commuters are satisfied, while
crumbling bridges and roads get worse and eventually have
to be replaced at enormous cost.

Another gap in owners’ portfolio management is
quantitative tools for financial and risk analysis, which help


in screening big projects. Respondents from oil and gas
and chemicals score more highly in this category, reflecting
the longer life spans of their assets, and the need to plan
ahead accordingly.

And it’s interesting to note that more than half of owners
say they now factor ESG factors into their capital allocation
and planning (Figure 10). Technology, government, and
power and utilities are ahead of the curve in this respect,
to some extent due to the heavy regulations and various
purchase agreements to limit CO2 emissions from power
plants and data centers. With growing demand for greener
and more equitable business practices, expect to see these
figures rise.


Engineering and construction
companies playing catch-up


Contractors appear to be a long way behind owners in
integrating ESG frameworks into their key capital decisions,
although respondents serving the technology, media and
telecoms industries look to have closed the gap somewhat.
Capital allocation is a further challenge for contractors—
just one-third of respondents say they have an allocation
framework (Figure 10).

Given the huge potential risks inherent in large projects,
contractors may want to consider why 47 percent do not
employ quantitative tools to perform financial and risk
analysis as part of the project selection process. One big
project failure can undermine the rest of the portfolio, so
rigorous due diligence is essential to reduce the risk
(Figure 10).


The bright spots for engineering and construction
companies are screening and prioritizing projects, where
they actually exceed owners in having robust processes.
Part of being a contractor is to produce a pipeline of
projects, so it’s understandable that there’s a greater focus
on this element of portfolio management.

Overall, it’s the contractors with annual revenue between
US$1 billion—US$5 billion who report the highest scores
for portfolio governance, processes and controls. Some
of the larger companies have grown rapidly through
acquisition and may still be coping with fragmented IT
systems, with management yet to fully integrate into the
organization.

KPMG thinks:

**Intelligence over intuition can lead to more rational planning**


Today’s construction projects involve a range of
stakeholders including owners, contractors and suppliers,
each with multiple projects of their own. One failure—like
a cost overrun—can have a devastating impact upon the
rest of the portfolio. In managing finite financial and human
resources, owners must take tough decisions on capital
allocation that fit the strategic goals of the organization,
rather than satisfying individual empire builders or
responding to short-term challenges. Infrastructure
illustrates this dilemma perfectly: a failure to maintain
existing assets can lead to an inability to cope with
environmental shocks like fires, flooding and unseasonably
hot and cold weather.


When a portfolio management process is based around
reliable data insights, decisions like screening and
selection and capital allocation become more rational;
there is less reliance upon power plays by different groups
and individuals, or knee-jerk responses to public opinion
(especially in the case of government infrastructure
programs).

Ongoing tracking of benefits is a key area for improvement.
Currently a minority of owners and contractors deploy
sophisticated software which gives assurance that their
investment strategies are generating value. Which may
explain why only 58 percent of the survey respondents
say they consistently monitor, track and report on benefits
realized from capital projects and programs (Figure 11).

**View from the industry**

Especially with the rising importance of ESG, organizations must get
better at managing issues from board strategy level right the way into the
organization. This may cause companies to change strategies and make
some tough and good decisions about what they will choose to do and no
longer do. It could take them into other areas around types of contract,
types of business, types of market they operate in. Some may exit and
others may enter, so it is likely to be a very dynamic environment.

# Diversity, equity  and inclusion

##### Enriching capabilities through diversity— from a low base


-----

Across all sectors, companies are striving to create more diverse and
[inclusive working environments. According to KPMG’s Global 2021 CEO](https://home.kpmg/xx/en/home/insights/2021/03/ceo-outlook-pulse.html)
_[Outlook, 96 percent of leaders say they’re increasingly scrutinizing their](https://home.kpmg/xx/en/home/insights/2021/03/ceo-outlook-pulse.html)_
organization’s diversity performance. But a majority (58 percent) also
admit that the business world as a whole has been far too slow to embrace
diversity and inclusion.

The global engineering and construction sector has not been historically
renowned for its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), something reflected in
this year’s survey, where most organizations’ efforts are shown to be
at a nascent stage—although owners seem to have made greater progress
than contractors. Only 46 percent of respondents’ organizations currently
have a formal program for building diverse and inclusive teams (Figure 12,
page 26), with the Americas ahead at 66 percent and Europe, Middle East
and Africa trailing with 29 percent.

Given the growing pressures on DEI in public projects,
it’s notable that relatively few of the companies who
participated in the survey say they have a strong focus on
diversity and inclusion in the supply chain. When asked
whether their company tracks and measures supply chain
diversity, 37 percent of executives from engineering and
construction companies responded that they don’t know
(Figure 13, page 27).


In the US, federal, state and local authorities have for
decades demanded supply chain checks and diligence,
which may explain why respondents from the Americas
region (53 percent) are the most likely to have assigned
specific jobs and functions dedicated to diversity and
inclusion in their suppliers.

KPMG thinks:

**Good for society; good for the construction**
**sector; good for business**

[In KPMG’s 2019 Global Construction Survey - Future-Ready Index, the](https://home.kpmg/xx/en/home/insights/2019/04/global-construction-survey-future-ready.html)
organizations defined as ‘innovative leaders’ in the sector demonstrated
significantly greater commitment to diversity as part of their drive to re-define
their cultures (Figure 14). They were more proactive in recruiting a diverse set
of workers and tracking their progress towards DEI. Innovative leaders were
characterized by cutting edge contractors with strong innovation cultures, and
owner-innovators who focus on technology—with an emphasis upon forwardlooking recruitment strategies.

A number of studies have shown that, across multiple industries, companies
with higher diversity outperform their peers in terms of revenue, profitability,
innovation and staff turnover (Figure 15, page 29). Additionally, a vast majority of
job candidates say that an organization’s approach to diversity and inclusion will
impact whether they accept a position.

A diverse and inclusive culture enriches organizational
capabilities and creates a talent pipeline, where the most
in-demand jobseekers are attracted by the potential to
have a fulfilling career in a safe and nurturing environment.
For women, people of color, LGBTQ+ and people with
disabilities, the knowledge that they are less likely to face
implicit bias, career roadblocks and ceilings is an enormous
plus and opens up a larger and more skilled resource pool.

But the level of commitment required to achieve such a
culture cannot be underestimated. The organization must
hold itself, its leaders and entire workforce accountable for
practicing DEI, should track and incentivize its performance
and highlight its successes and challenges in a fully
transparent manner.


Engineering and construction companies have the
additional pressure of ever-stricter contractual obligations
from project owners to meet DEI targets in their own
company and along the supply chain. National and local
government in many countries have already established
such criteria, with private sector owners moving in the
same direction as they seek to embed ESG principles. It’s
common now to see tender proposals stipulating use of
minority or women-owned vendors, diverse recruitment
policies and inclusive workforce and leadership quotas.
Failure to adapt to such demands can severely undermine
contractors’ ability to win new contracts.


-----

**View from the industry**

Delivering major projects is a team sport, dependent on a vast number of people coming together. We cannot deliver
them alone and we cannot continue doing things the way we have in the past.

Capital investment in infrastructure is money well spent and helps create a better world. We must embrace the
opportunity to be part of the green recovery and economy. Highways England will be part of the solution, integrating
our network with other transport modes and using investment in strategic roads as an enabler. We’ve reorganized,
creating strong alliances that are accelerating the trend to offsite production with digitally rehearsed and designed
modular components. We have digital design teams and project management hubs who are making production
management and efficient delivery happen at pace.

Our industry needs to move on beyond the image of building everything on a muddy construction site. We are
listening, adapting and setting the tone for the future. The skills of people running major projects will change, creating
an opportunity to recruit from a wider field of skilled people. We will need more than just experienced civil engineers
as over the coming years, 50 percent of roles in our industry will be brand new. We will need people who have a
relationship with digital capability, as this is where the real opportunities lie.

In the future we want our supply chain and our industry to employ a more diverse workforce, with wider skills. One
that creates more challenge and stimulates creativity, that welcomes what makes us each unique and builds on what
we have in common, to improve our industry.

# Technology and innovation

##### Time to be bold  and brave


-----

Technology has become ubiquitous to all sectors and is no longer something
left to the innovators. Which is why the response to the pandemic has been
so interesting, in that the more forward-thinking companies really enjoyed
the benefits of their previous investments. With large numbers working from
home, and site workers on staggered shifts, remote collaboration came
into its own, enabling managers to plan and design, keep abreast of project
progress, make virtual inspections, and communicate instructions and
changes in real time.

These successes cannot, however, mask the mixed efforts to adopt
technology, with many contractors and, especially, owners, lacking the
tools that could create a step-change in project performance and increase
resilience to further shocks.

What’s driving
investment choices?

The desire to adopt technology appears strong, with most of the
respondents reporting that their companies plan a moderate or high level of
investment. But there’s a noticeable gap between owners and contractors,
with the latter considerably more likely to invest heavily (50 percent versus
just 33 percent for owners) (Figure 16, page 33).

This presents an opportunity for owners to step up their program
management—especially as ‘adoption of technology’ was rated as the
second most important factor that enabled engineering and construction
companies to cope with disruptive events.

With projects getting larger and more complex, it’s
surprising that less than four in ten are using portfolio level
planning software (Figure 17). Such tools are essential
for planning and tracking projects across the portfolio—
especially relevant to owners with a number of ongoing
initiatives across different geographies.

**Survey participant feedback**

During the pandemic-forced lockdowns,
we switched to virtual meetings on
collaborative platforms to keep our
projects operational. We also used
internet enabled devices such as smart
glasses to support remote inspections and
overcome travel constraints.


When asked which technologies have the greatest
potential, the top three responses are integrated PMIS,
Building Information Modeling (BIM) and advanced data
and analytics (Figure 10, page 20). Both owners and
engineering and construction companies believe these
innovations can give a healthy return on investment by
increasing efficiency and improving decision-making.


-----

In stark contrast, there is negligible interest at present
in many up-and-coming technologies like artificial
intelligence (AI), radio frequency identification (RFID),
3D Printing, cognitive machine learning (ML), robotics,


process automation (RPA), digital labor and augmented
reality. It seems as if the industry is waiting for some
positive use cases before buying into such advances.

Integrating technology for a richer
picture


Integration offers a great opportunity to automate and
streamline projects. Project managers can survey a rich
history of past projects to develop early cost estimates and
schedules, as well as making more reliable cost forecasts.
Procurement and logistics should also become more
accurate, as decision-makers can see what’s happening
across multiple sites and work out a logical flow of supplies
to meet the pace of projects. Data security and privacy is
another beneficiary of integration, reducing the number
of attacks and introducing common access protocol to
decrease the chance of breaches by malicious and/or
criminal hackers.


Faced with a wide range of geographies, fragmented
supply chains, and a constant stream of new software,
companies can struggle to effectively integrate risk
management and project management. Only 16 percent of
the executives surveyed say their organizations have fully
integrated systems and tools (Figure 18). It’s a similar story
when it comes to automation—with just 6 percent claiming
to have automated all or most of their business processes
(Figure 19, page 36). Automation has the capability to
replace and speed up manual tasks and provide more
current and accurate intelligence. The three areas where
capital projects could most benefit are listed as project
reporting, estimating and budgeting, and performance
monitoring.

Lack of alignment in technology
ambitions


The responses to this year’s survey suggest that owners
and contractors don’t always pursue the same technology
investment patterns, with the latter tending to be the early
adopters across many categories, notably integrated
PMIS, drones, BIM and advanced data and analytics
(Figure 20). Project owners’ focus has often been on

**Figure 20: Level of technology adoption**


investment oversight, tracking, performance reporting,

firms’ minds are firmly on the task in hand, calling for
better management of project data and on-ground project

Interestingly, owners are keen on the potential of
automation to improve performance monitoring, contract
management and payment management, reflecting their
role as buyers of services. Engineering and construction


companies, on the other hand, value the power of
automation in areas like construction, design and schedule
management.


-----

KPMG thinks:

**Collaboration can lead to common gains**

One of the questions that senior industry executives should
ask themselves is: how can we develop a more uniform
and coherent adoption of technologies to enhance project
performance metrics? If all parties can access the same
platforms and software, then it will be easier and faster
to move through the various stages of conceptualization,
design, implementation and even operationalization.

The industry collectively stands at a crossroads: either
continue the current path of conservative, disjointed and
experimental investment by individual stakeholders—or
collaborate for common gains. In certain sectors, such
as government infrastructure and construction programs,
the use of technology is already stipulated in the contract
for tools like BIM, to approve designs. Yes, owners can
force digitization via contracts, but this eats into alreadythin margins for contractors. Surely it’s preferable for
project owners to go one step further and invest in these
groundbreaking innovations in a way that benefits every
contractor they work with?

Such a move may start to break down the lines of
responsibility between owner and contractor, in the
interests of efficiency, safety and quality. When owners
have a large pipeline of known projects, a common data
environment enables each contractor to ‘plug in’ to access
cloud-based software and hardware. Take the increasing
demand to demonstrate ESG: a common platform and
reporting enables the owners to track carbon footprint,
people management and community contributions. All
of which should make projects more robust and less
susceptible to delays, cost-overruns and accidents.

Finally, both owners and engineering and construction
companies should invest in relatively untapped
technologies like AI, machine learning, robotic process
automation and digital labor.


**View from the industry**

We have adopted digital tools like drone-based
analytics for progress monitoring, real-time CCTV
monitoring of project site and dashboard-based
reporting. Additionally, we’ve initiated use of smart
glasses: a head-mounted, hands-free, voice-controlled
device for bi-directional audio-visual communication
between a project person and remote expert. This has
facilitated installation and commissioning activities and
minimized site visits.

# Moving construction into the 21st Century

**Bent Flyvbjerg,**
_BT Professor and Chair of Major Programme Management,_
_Saïd Business School, University of Oxford_

We still build houses the way we did 4,000 years ago—the main difference
is electricity and glass. With a lack of competition on a global scale, the
sector has struggled to innovate, leaving a productivity gap compared to
other industries. One obvious solution is to go modular, to have everything
manufactured off site and assembled on site like Lego. Using standardized
station designs and other new approaches, between 1995—1999, Madrid
managed to build 56 km of railway lines at a cost of US$26.7 million per km,[1]
whereas shorter but comparable rail projects performed relatively poorly,
taking significantly longer to complete at a much higher cost per kilometer.

Owners are looking at the wrong place by focusing on companies delivering;
they need to create demand for innovation by insisting contractors use
BIM and prefab, and in a competent manner. For instance, wind turbines
used to be built like houses by pouring concrete on site, but that’s not the
case anymore—they’ve gone modular and prefab. This happened because
governments, through subsidies, created a market for wind, in the process
moving towards a global, competitive market. The industry won't change by
itself. It needs to be pushed and pulled from outside.

# Transcendent action plan


-----

**1**

Owners should explore collaborative and integrated project teaming
models, rebalance risk allocation in projects, avoiding excessive risk to
engineering and construction companies, who in turn should exercise
greater caution in taking on high-risk, fixed price projects.

**2**

Establish an independent risk management function for portfolios and
projects, reporting into a board-level risk management committee. This
provides an extra layer of awareness and comfort over the total level of
risk across the project portfolio. At the same time, it’s important to continue
to focus on the fundamentals of risk management at all levels of the
organization, with a commitment to a culture of continuous improvement.

**3**

Invest in portfolio planning software and a formal, embedded asset
management team. This should help ensure that capital allocation
decisions reflect the organization’s wider interests, and that investments in
projects generate the optimum ROI.

**4**

Commit at leadership level to embrace diversity, internally and across the
supply chain, forming a dedicated diversity team, setting targets, awarding
incentives, and tracking and publishing diversity and inclusion numbers.

**5**

Bridge the technology gap between owners and engineering and
construction companies, with owners investing in shared platforms to
enable contractors to access technologies like integrated PMIS, BIM and
advanced analytics.
