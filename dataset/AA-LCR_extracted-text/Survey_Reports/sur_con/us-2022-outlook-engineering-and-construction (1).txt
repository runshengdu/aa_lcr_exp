**About the Deloitte survey**

To understand the outlook and perspectives of organizations across the energy, resources, and industrials
industries, Deloitte fielded a survey of more than 500 US executives and other senior leaders in September
2021. The survey captured insights from respondents in five specific industry groups: chemicals and specialty
materials, engineering and construction, industrial products, oil and gas, and power and utilities.

**Several factors positioning industry for strong growth amid headwinds**


The industry responded very well during the pandemic and
has come out strong in the recovery period. Total construction
spending recovered and peaked at $1.57 trillion in July 2021, a
record high for the series and 12% higher than 2019 average
levels.[8] The Associated Builders and Contractors’ Construction
Confidence Index (CCI), which had plummeted to 38.1 in March
2020, recovered and hovered at 60+ levels during the first half
of 2021, signaling consistent expansion in sales.[9] Order backlogs
stood at 8.5 months in July 2021, well above pandemic-induced
lows, though still below average 2019 levels.[10] In a recent survey
(see “About the Deloitte survey”), 91% of E&C respondents
characterize the business outlook for their industry as somewhat
or very positive, 23% higher than last year. Driving this business
confidence is the expected strong performance of the residential
segment and growth from the nonresidential segment due to the
$1 trillion IIJA.

Looking into the two segments in more detail, residential activities
continued to stay strong despite rising material prices and the
spread of the coronavirus Delta variant. The segment posted
record spending levels of about $770 billion in July 2021, 27%
higher than last year and almost 30% higher than prepandemic
levels.[11] The housing segment exhibited strong growth on the back
of low mortgage rates and experienced improvements across both
single- and multifamily new construction.[12] Provided mortgage
rates remain at similar levels and no new variants surge, housing
starts are likely to stay strong, further aiding residential segment
growth in 2022.[13]


In contrast, nonresidential segment spending growth remained
weak for much of 2021.[14] Spending across educational, office,
transportation, health care, and commercial facilities observed the
largest year-over-year (YoY) decline in July 2021.[15] Overall, spending
levels in July were 11% lower than prepandemic levels (February
2020).[16] Weakness in spending calls for additional funding for
infrastructure projects, and investments through the recently
approved IIJA might provide that.

Per the recently approved IIJA, $550 billion in new federal
investments would be made to upgrade America’s infrastructure
over five years, including $110 billion on roads, bridges, and major
infrastructure projects, $66 billion on passenger and freight rail,
$55 billion on water infrastructure, $40 billion on bridge repair, and
$39 billion in public transit infrastructure.[17] Additionally, the bill
has other tax incentives to promote partnerships with cities and
states and encourage private investments.[18] The bill bodes well for
E&C firms and is likely to propel some growth in the nonresidential
segment. In addition to infrastructure work, E&C firms are likely to
see a further mix of projects coming through with data centers,
warehousing, and even health care likely to observe more activity
than offices or commercial segments.[19] The bill would provide
$65 billion to expand high-speed internet access; $110 billion for
roads, bridges, and other projects; and $25 billion for airports.[20]
In 2022, both residential and commercial segments are expected
to present substantial opportunities for E&C companies compared
with 2021, where the residential and nonresidential segments grew
at different rates.

**Industry profitability and performance**

**Supply chain disruption and sourcing challenges likely to affect project delivery and margins**


increased by 3.4%.[29] Low profitability and margins have been a
bane for the E&C industry for far too long, and such a mismatch
between cost and bid price will exacerbate the problem. Per a
recent Deloitte survey, 20% of E&C industry respondents indicated
that operating profitability and industry margins are likely to further
deteriorate in 2022.

Contractors should be proactive in managing processes and
operations that contribute to margins and profitability, adding
efficiencies and optimization where possible. The integration
of digital technologies into the supply chain could help. These
advanced networks, now ubiquitously known as digital supply
networks (DSNs), can help contractors gain better visibility into the
availability and movement of materials. Analytics performed on
real-time data can help schedulers make better-informed decisions
and develop alternate sourcing strategies and forward-looking
insights to ensure minimum impact on projects. Smart project
management can also help bring suppliers, vendor and contract
management, and materials management onto a single platform.
E&C firms should make these investments not just in isolated
projects, but also across the enterprise level to bring all areas of
sourcing online.

In a recent Deloitte survey, 61% of E&C respondents indicated
strategic sourcing and category management as an area they
are likely to invest in during 2022. Another strategy is to develop
prefabrication and modular construction capabilities, helping firms
save costs and reduce sourcing complexity. The industry can also
come together to form a supplier collaboration network to help
bring in new sourcing strategies and reduce the current material
supply volatilities. Overall, supply chain disruptions and volatility
are expected to be among the biggest challenges in 2022, and the
firms that can navigate through them will likely emerge as winners.


During the second half of 2020, the pandemic exposed the
vulnerabilities of global supply chains. Supply issues were expected
to stabilize moving into 2021 as both global production resumed
and supplies normalized. However, pandemic-induced supply
shortages persist, affecting key materials such as lumber, paint
and coatings, aluminum, steel, and cement, among others. These
disruptions are due to multiple factors, the first being pent-up
demand for key materials as global construction activity resumed.
For example, the Aluminum Association reported that aluminum
demand in the United States and Canada totaled 8.8 billion pounds
through the first four months of 2021, increasing from 2.1 billion
pounds in the first four months of 2020, when the pandemic was
beginning.[21] Further exacerbating the situation are disruptions in
the movement of materials due to increased congestion and delays
at major ports such as Yantian and Ningbo in China.[22] The delays
are also leading to a spike in freight costs, which are on average
three to five times higher than last year’s level.[23]

The impact of this crisis is twofold. The first challenge is the lack
of materials; per an Associated General Contractors of America
(ACG) survey, 75% of E&C firms indicated project delays due to
longer lead times or shortage of materials.[24] Further, 57% reported
delivery delays, indicating that the industry has difficulty predicting
when materials would arrive.[25] The second impact is sharply
increased costs; during the first seven months of 2021, the prices
of critical construction materials prices observed double-digit
increases every month.[26] For example, the producer price index
(PPI) for steel mill products increased by more than 120%, copper
and brass by 45%, plastic construction products by 30%, and
lumber and plywood by 15.9%—all year over year in August 2021.[27]

A look at the Turner Building Cost Index (which measures costs
in the nonresidential building construction market in the United
States) indicates that costs in Q2 2021 peaked and are nearly
back to Q1 2020 levels.[28] The worrying aspect for US construction
companies is that while input costs have increased by more than
26% year over year in June 2021, average bid prices have only

**Connected construction**

**Connected construction to help the industry unlock new value streams**


The industry landscape is rapidly evolving as engineering firms,
contractors, and participants across the value chain realize the
benefits of, and increasingly deploy, connected construction
technologies. These technologies can help bring assets, people,
processes, and job sites onto one platform, making everyone
and everything work smarter, reduce downtime, optimize asset
utilization and efficiency, and gain greater visibility into operations.
These technologies include building information management (BIM),
digital supply networks, digital twins, predictive maintenance,
prefabrication and modular construction, asset tracking, and
autonomous drones, among many others. In a recent Deloitte
survey, 43% of E&C executives indicated greater investments in
new design processes, such as focusing on BIM, over the next
year.[30]

At the core of connected construction are emerging technologies
and the data and advanced analytics that these new capabilities
can enable. Also, at the center of these investments is the creation
of command centers or control towers that can drive visibility and
velocity across a portfolio of projects. As the industry moves toward
connected construction, developing data, analytics, and user-based
insights capabilities could be critical. Connected construction is
likely to present several benefits in the future besides helping
businesses transform their problem-solving approach from


reactive to predictive. However, many other aspects of connected
construction are likely to pick up pace in the coming year. A larger
integration of modularization and prefabrication approaches into
the design and build processes is at the forefront as more E&C
firms begin to distribute their build and sourcing capabilities.
Another aspect of connected construction is better control over
emissions through dynamic, always-on monitoring, not just during
design and build, but also during the operate phase. End-to-end
operations management, known as Design-Build-Operate-OwnMaintain (DBOOM), can likely facilitate this aspect and help E&C
firms improve potential margins while reducing emissions during
the project life cycle.[31]

In 2022, connected construction will likely be a catch-all for
major digital investments to connect, integrate, and automate
operations and bring the entire value chain onto a secure,
intelligent infrastructure. Growing digital and technology capability
requirements from the commercial construction segment are also
likely to push adoption. Similar to last year, building connected
capabilities will likely be a priority on CIOs’ growth agenda as they
look to enhance their ability to make data-driven decisions, better
control costs and schedule variances, and ensure timely project
delivery across multiple sites.[32]

**Mergers and acquisitions (M&A)**

**M&A to help build broad-based capabilities**

In 2020, most E&C firms were focused on being risk-averse and
conserving cash to maintain liquidity. 2021, however, provides a
stark contrast, as transaction levels for the first nine months are
already 152% higher than the full year 2020 and 10% higher than
all activity in 2019.[33] The US E&C industry ramped up M&A activity,
registering $16 billion in deal value, during the first eight months of
2021.[34] At this pace, the industry is likely to exceed the $20 billion
deal value mark by the end of the year.[35] In terms of deal volume,
the industry is not a long way off 2020 levels, registering 383 deals
during the first eight months of 2021 compared with 477 deals in
2020.[36] This indicates that the industry has been bold and more
open to bigger acquisitions versus 2020, when the focus was largely
on acquiring smaller and more specialized firms. There have been
seven deals larger than $500 million this year, compared with just
three in 2020.[37]

E&C companies have also shown renewed interest in technology
and telecom targets to gain faster access to new digital capabilities
and solutions. Between August 2020 and 2021, US E&C firms
acquired as many as 27 targets across the software, electronics,
technology consulting and services, and motion picture fields.[38]
A move in the right direction, this is further anticipated to pick up
pace in 2022 as E&C firms work toward acquiring technologies to
help develop a connected, integrated, and automated operations
foundation. These technology investments are in addition to
increased venture capital funding across construction technology
startups in the United States.[39] Additionally, E&C firms are likely
to form public-private partnerships (PPPs) with cities and states to
capture opportunities from the recently approved IIJA.


Another trend consistent with our 2021 outlook is E&C companies
realigning their exposure to end markets via targeted divestiture
efforts. In 2021, the pace of divestitures remained strong, with
50 divestitures announced during the first eight months of 2021
compared with 76 in 2020.[40] In fact, all four billion-dollar deals
announced during the first eight months of 2021 have been
divestitures, with E&C firms either divesting noncore businesses to
focus on major end markets, exiting low-margin product segments,
or balancing exposure to underperforming end markets.[41] In a
recent Deloitte survey, 41% of E&C respondents indicated plans to
diversify their businesses to reduce exposure to underperforming
segments. Yet another trend consistent with the 2021 outlook
is a renewed focus on nontraditional M&A approaches, such
as forming alliances with technology vendors via an ecosystem
approach. Developing or becoming part of such an ecosystem can
help E&C companies gain access to new capabilities and turnkey
solutions faster, without the need for up-front investments.[42] As we
move into 2022, the industry could see another strong year from
traditional M&As as well as ecosystems and PPPs.

**Firms continuing to grapple with labor shortages as workforce landscape evolves**


Emerging from the pandemic, the biggest question on the minds
of most E&C firms was how to restart work at job sites safely.
Surprisingly, while the industry quickly implemented the required
safety standards, it is still trying to overcome the challenge of
attracting workers. By August 2021, the industry had yet to
recover about 20% of jobs lost to the pandemic, while many
other labor-competing industries, such as transportation and
warehousing, had recovered all jobs lost.[43] More worryingly, the
industry lost an additional 3,000 jobs in August 2021, while overall
US nonfarm employment increased by 230,000, further highlighting
the dichotomy.[44]

Most E&C contractors are eager to hire, as evidenced by job
openings across the industry hitting a two-year high.[45] However,
only 4,000 net payroll additions during the first eight months of
2021 may signal significant issues in getting people through the
door.[46] Labor shortages could reach crisis proportions, as the
current situation is expected to continue through 2022. In a recent
Deloitte survey, 52% of E&C executives indicate their organization
is facing a severe labor and talent shortage on the job site. The
impact of not filling job openings can negatively affect E&C firms
in more ways than one, including project delays and cancellations,
projects being scaled back, inability to respond to market needs,
losing project bids, and failing to innovate, among others. Per
an August 2021 survey by the Associated General Contractors
of America (AGCA), six in 10 firms reported experiencing project
delays due to workforce shortages, leading to projects being
canceled or postponed.[47]


Another factor compounding labor shortages is a lack of qualified
candidates. As the industry is creating new roles that are digitally
oriented, companies are seeking data engineers, data scientists,
coders, and developers. But attracting talent in these roles
is a challenge as there is strong competition with technology
companies. This skills gap is partly driven by industry advances into
integrating digital technologies with key workstreams to further
enhance productivity, efficiency, and worker safety. The penetration
of digital technologies requires workforce optimization both in
terms of skills needed to perform the job and the knowledge
of digital technologies such as digital twins, smart project
management, and connected construction.[48] For instance, many
E&C firms have analyzed how jobs will evolve and are hiring more
software programmers, data researchers, and data scientists than
traditional engineers.[49]

In addition to reskilling, two other important elements to
unleash true workforce potential include engaging in open talent
ecosystems and expanding talent and opportunity marketplaces.[50]
More companies across industries are considering expanding their
workforce beyond full-time and part-time positions, and engaging
in external ecosystems can help them access diverse external
contributors. In a recent Deloitte survey, 60% of E&C respondents
indicated plans to engage in open talent ecosystems to address
workforce challenges. Furthermore, the E&C industry can also
leverage opportunity marketplaces, internal platforms that can
help the workforce focus on work type and not roles, also providing
them additional learning, growth, and progression opportunities. As
we move into 2022, adapting existing talent strategies and forming
new talent management and workforce experience strategies could
be critical to navigating workforce challenges.

**2022 engineering and construction industry outlook**

### Poised to accelerate

The industry has made a significant recovery from a
recession on the back of a robust residential market in
2021, but it has also experienced multiple headwinds
that are expected to persist in 2022. Labor shortages
and supply chain disruptions have hit the industry
hard, leading to project delays, rising costs, and further
margin erosion. Simultaneously, digital technology
continues to make its way into the industry, making it
important for E&C firms to focus on developing data
and analytics as a core competency. M&A is likely
to provide some much-needed impetus to acquire,
develop, and integrate these capabilities. Another
aspect to consider is talent management strategies:
finding the right people and training and reskilling them
to enable the work and workplaces of tomorrow. 2022
is expected to be another rewarding, but challenging
year, and the industry looks to be poised to capture
growth opportunities.
