**Rising influence of**
**ESG**

**The great**
**innovation race**



-  Two-thirds (66 percent) of respondents are optimistic about the direction of the construction market, and 78
percent feel infrastructure stimuli will have a positive impact.

-  Yet project performance remains in the spotlight, with only half of owners saying their projects are completing
on time and 87 percent stating that projects are coming under greater scrutiny.

-  To address ongoing volatility, the biggest priority is improving estimating accuracy, transferring risk, and
increasing innovation.

-  ESG has climbed construction leaders’ agendas, with 54 percent “fully envisioning” the benefits of ESG and
aggressively pursuing maturity. Survey respondents say the key benefits of ESG are reputational improvement
and competitive advantage—as well as a necessity to enhance access to project capital

-  Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) is the third most important factor determining future success, as the sector
shifts away from its hard-hat image toward greater use of technology and more remote working.

-  Owners are relatively more concerned with reducing greenhouse gases (GHG) while E&C companies place the
highest priority on DEI. Embodied carbon (carbon released during the construction process) is a growing concern
and is likely to be the subject of future regulations.

-  The construction industry is starting to embrace the power of technology to transform performance—with 81
percent of E&C firms adopting mobile platforms, 43 percent using robotics process automation (RPA) and 40
percent adopting artificial intelligence (AI)—although many are in the early stages.

-  When it comes to improving ROI on capability projects, project management information systems (PMIS),
building information modeling (BIM), and advanced data analytics are considered to have the greatest potential;
digital twins, modular/offsite manufacturing, AI, and BIM are driving the greatest gains in project performance.

-  A vast majority of respondents say prefabrication is an important solution for capability projects, although just
one-quarter of E&C companies use modular manufacturing across all projects.

-  There’s growing recognition of the power of technology to improve safety, notably from use of D&A and modular
manufacturing—the latter reduces dangerous, onsite work.

With a significant post-COVID-19 pipeline,
government infrastructure funding in the
U.S. and beyond, and ESG demands driving
renewable energy and circular economy
projects, it’s perhaps little surprise that many of
the respondents to the 2023 Global Construction
Survey are in a positive frame of mind.

Two-thirds of this year’s respondents (66
percent) say they are optimistic about the
direction of the construction market and 38
percent of project owners are “very optimistic”
(see Exhibit 1) compared to just 18 percent in
2021. And the proportion of owners anticipating
greater than 20 percent capital program growth
has more than tripled from 10 percent in 2021 to
36 percent in 2023 (see Exhibit 1), the highest
figure in the 20-year history of the survey.

Four out of 10 E&C respondents expect revenue
growth in the next 12 months to be greater than
10 percent, with just 18 percent predicting zero
or negative growth (see Exhibit 2). E&C firms
remain more cautious than project owners,
but only a small proportion (7 percent) express


pessimism about the future state of the
market—the corresponding figure for 2021 was
29 percent (see Exhibit 1). With contractors in
the middle of supply chain disruptions and with
limited visibility into owners’ robust capital plans,
such differences are to be expected.

There’s also plenty of excitement about the
prospect of government funding, investment and
stimuli for large-scale infrastructure programs,
such as Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce
Semiconductors (CHIPS) and Science Act,
Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and Infrastructure
Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) in the U.S.,
India’s Production Linked Incentives (PLI) and
Make in India campaigns, and similar programs


in other countries. According to global research
from Oxford Economics, civil engineering is
set to be the fastest-growing sector in the
construction market.[1] More than one-third of
survey participants (35 percent) feel this
funding will have a significant impact and a
further 43 percent expect a moderate impact
(see Exhibit 3).

### Project performance in the spotlight


Despite the confidence expressed by
respondents, the industry continues to face a
number of challenges, in the form of continued
supply chain disruption, high energy and
materials prices, and labor shortages that are
further pushing up costs and holding up projects.

The after-effects of COVID-19 are still apparent,
with 45 percent of respondents saying they have
experienced a pandemic-related schedule delay
or cost impact of more than 20 percent (see
Exhibit 4).

And the sector continues to struggle with
poor project performance, with 37 percent of
respondents reporting that they’ve missed
budget and/or schedule performance targets
over the past year due to lack of effective risk
management—this is up from 32 percent in
the corresponding 2021 survey (see Exhibit 5).
In fact, only half of owners’ projects are being
completed on time.

Consequently, owners are seeing increased
interest in the economics of large capital
projects, with 87 percent stating that they’re
coming under greater scrutiny (see Exhibit 6).
Indeed, 28 percent of project owners say they’re
facing “greatly increased” focus and scrutiny.

Volatility has fueled market challenges, but so
have the continued stagnant productivity and
lack of innovation in E&C. Much of this is due
to a highly fragmented structure where many
players have neither the size nor the incentive
to invest in new technology or methodologies,
especially when contractors take on paper-thin
margins that leave little room for error. Between
1997 and 2021, construction productivity actually
fell by 7 percent, whereas in the manufacturing
sector it rose by 126 percent.

Inadequate risk management has hardly helped,
with insufficient linkage between project risk
management and enterprise risk management
that prevents owners and contractors from
accurately aggregating all their risks to fully
understand their corporate risk profile. With a
multitude of players, a dearth of data sharing and
interoperability, and a siloed value chain, visibility
across individual and multiple projects is often
lacking. Project managers are often unable to
identify and address poor performing projects,
sites, or individuals.

### How is the industry responding to high volatility  and poor performance?


According to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
in March 2023, construction costs rose 17.3
percent year-on-year.[2] Add to this the war in
Ukraine, the West potentially de-coupling its
economy from China, resource constraints,
and ongoing supply chain disruption, and it’s
evident that E&C firms and project owners face
continuous volatility.

In response, 83 percent of survey participants
say their single biggest priority is improving the
estimating accuracy of materials and equipment,
which accounts for a significant proportion
of project costs (see Exhibit 7). Achieving


better contractual protection—which is about
transferring risk—is another key imperative for
both owners and contractors. However, such
an approach can damage owner/contractor
relationships at a time when the two parties
should work together more closely to enable
owners to better manage their own risks.
With both owners and contractors attempting
to transfer risk, there is likely to be an impasse,
although continued tightness in the market
should favor contractors, who are in high
demand.

We are seeing a dramatic shift by
contractors away from fixed-price and
guaranteed maximum-price contracts
for major projects. Whether this is the
result of learning from past mistakes,
acknowledging that systems and tools
are still not where they need to be, or
simply driven by boards, bankers or risk
officers, one thing is clear: we cannot
expect business as usual. Contractors
are no longer willing to assume primary
responsibility for performance risk and,
as contractors transition to more open-
ended, cost-plus and time-and-materials
contracts, owners will need to adjust
how they control projects and programs.”

Further potential options include longer planning
periods to better manage project scope,
schedule and quantities, which, regrettably, is
not always an option in commercial and missioncritical projects.

When it comes to dealing with disruptive
events, respondents are placing a greater
focus on innovation (up to 74 percent from 60
percent) and workplace demographics (up to 49
percent from 42 percent) than in the previous
2021 Global Construction Survey (see Exhibit
8). Effective risk management processes and
resilience planning are also on the “to-do” list to
help build resilience.

Finally, given the risks inherent in the market in general, and in large and mega-projects in particular,
E&C companies and capital project owners are seeking ways to improve portfolio-wide risk
management. Their number one aim is to achieve clearly defined and standardized risk management
processes and controls. There is a greater emphasis upon accurate risk reporting (up to 36 percent
from 25 percent) and establishing a dedicated risk management department (up to 20 percent from
17 percent) compared to the previous 2021 survey (see Exhibit 9).

### Cracking the productivity and performance code

How can the E&C industry break the vicious
cycle of poor performance, low productivity, and
major project failures?

From a risk management perspective, the ability
to aggregate risk at an enterprise level can bring
a clearer view of portfolio risk, to avoid taking
on projects that could break the company, as
well as identifying emerging risks earlier to
enable preventative action. Better transparency,
allied with D&A, opens up understanding of
risk interdependence, both within and across
projects.

There are a number of ways to improve
productivity, including the use of IoT sensors and
data analytics to detect and assess problems
like damage—this enables rapid response times
that help minimize delays and cost overruns.
Benchmarks for team performance can be
easily created through shared data. Predictive
maintenance—which can increase the likelihood
of heavy equipment staying operational and
minimizes shutdowns. Access to suppliers’ data
helps anticipate supply chain delays or shortages

earlier, enabling procurement teams to seek
alternative sources.

It’s also important to drive capital efficiency and
effectiveness in a transparent and integrated
manner. The first step is a robust capital planning
and portfolio management process that is well
integrated into project governance and PMO
activities through strong processes. Dashboards
and KPIs show the status and performance of
projects and portfolios, and also provide insights
into updated business cases linked to operations
as well as customer and supply chain plans and
models. (To learn more, read our recent paper,
CapEx decisions in a downturn[3].)


In a fragmented sector, E&C companies have
an opportunity to form construction ecosystems
where data and insights flow between
contractors, suppliers, and owners to introduce
a common understanding of project delivery
objectives that’s aided by greater supply chain
transparency.

And finally, by paying careful attention to asset
owners’ customer experience, it’s possible to
create more society-friendly projects that reduce
negative impact, whether it’s reducing noise and
pollution, or avoiding transport closures.

## The rising  influence of ESG

## The rising influence of ESG

Our recent paper, Construction in 2030[4], notes how the industry is regarded as high-carbon, high-waste, and highpolluting, with significant use of scarce resources like water and minerals, moderate usage of renewable energy, and
limited progress with diversity in what remains a male-dominated sector. At the same time, E&C companies face
growing regulatory pressure for sustainability in both its construction methods and the buildings and infrastructure it
produces. Failure to meet such demands could impact access to—and push up the cost of—capital.

Looking back to our Global Construction
Survey from 15 years ago, the top drivers for
sustainability among E&C companies (see
Exhibit 10) was to position themselves as
innovative or environmentally aware (cited by
56 percent of respondents), and to increase
business opportunities and competitiveness
(29 percent).

However, in the 2023 survey, we see a strong
commitment from the respondents. Nearly
54 percent fully envision the benefits of ESG
and are aggressively pursuing maturity and
improvement, whereas, nearly 37 percent see
some benefit in ESG and are using targeted
approach (Exhibit 10). In addition, nearly 50
percent of E&C firms view implementing
ESG into capital projects and programs as a
competitive advantage (Exhibit 11).

Project owners taking part in our global survey
show substantially greater maturity in their
approach to ESG compared to E&C companies.
In the U.S. in particular, they face increasingly
stringent legislation, procurement requirements,
and building code improvements, and any
laggards will have to play a fast game of catch-up.

When asked about the key benefits of embedding
ESG into capital projects and programs,
the top two responses were reputational
improvement and competitive advantage. Half
of E&C companies see opportunities to gain a
competitive edge through ESG, suggesting that
they’re beginning to grasp the value of more fully
embracing ESG (see Exhibit 11). Respondents
from E&C also consider safe, inclusive sites as
a benefit, reflecting a desire to attract a wider
range of workers.

And 32 percent of owners recognize the need to
integrate ESG in order to enhance their access
to capital to fund projects (see Exhibit 11)—an
acknowledgment of the importance of strong
sustainability credentials to satisfy investors.

Interestingly, project owners and E&C firms
differ in their views over the most crucial ESG
trends. The former feel that reducing GHG output
and developing renewable facilities are most
important, while contractors are more concerned
with social considerations, such as DEI, and
meeting government requirements.

As the three forces of ‘Environmental,’ ‘Social,’ and ‘Governance’ converge, E&C companies and
project owners are set to accelerate their investment in ESG.”

**Geno Armstrong, Global Lead and Principal, Infrastructure, Capital Projects, and Climate Advisory**

This discrepancy is understandable as owners
are currently being measured by Scope 1 and
Scope 2 emissions of their facilities, whereas
service providers gain market advantage by
improving their DEI performance and adhering to
requirements. As increasing Scope 3 regulations
come into effect globally, owners are likely to
ask service providers to disclose embodied as
well as operational carbon, which in turn will
direct the industry’s focus to total lifetime GHG
emissions.

any construction project, and respondents listed
the three most important practices as energy
efficiency, reducing construction waste, and
more efficient use of materials.

The built environment generates around 40 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions
(GHGs) and uses approximately 40 percent of global energy resources. It is, therefore, no
surprise that ESG regulatory and stakeholder pressure is on the increase. The industry has
also shifted its thinking since our 2008 Global Construction Survey—where sustainability was
thought of primarily as a profit vehicle—to 2023, where a higher proportion of leaders see ESG
as a core element of business strategy. The next step is to operationalize ESG principles into
capital projects to increase efficiency and sustainability, reduce waste, avoid greenwashing,
mitigate risks, and enhance long-term value for all stakeholders.”

Embodied carbon: The missing half of GHG emissions

Up to half of all carbon emissions are emitted before the building is operational, as a result of
embodied carbon: the amount of the GHG emitted during the manufacturing, transportation,
installation, maintenance, and disposal of building materials.

To date, facilities, real estate, and construction functions have ignored this half of their carbon
emissions and it’s not just them; current standards, guidelines, codes, and measurements
mostly focus on operational carbon (from heating, air conditioning, and operating the facility)
emissions. This presents a huge opportunity for many teams to further their commitments
to decarbonization. For more on this vital topic, read our recent report, Embodied carbon: the
missing half of GHG emissions.

### Continuing efforts to improve worker safety


The construction sector has made impressive
advances in worker safety in the past decades,
and the responses to our global survey suggest
that companies continue to prioritize this vital
area. For both project owners and E&C firms,
the single most crucial factor is the tried-andtrusted behavioral, leadership and cultural
change, to create a climate with zero-tolerance
towards accidents. Respondents—especially
owners—are keen to increase safety monitoring
and onsite health and wellness testing of
workers, to reduce the risk of incidents.

Technology also plays more of a role to create
safer working spaces, with respondents making
greater use of data and analytics (D&A) to
predict and prevent, as well as modular/offsite
fabrication to reduce potentially dangerous
onsite tasks. Our survey results suggest that
other innovations are at an earlier stage, with
less frequent use, such as smart sensors and
monitors, drones, remote-operated machines,
and robotics. The low take-up of such potentially
advantageous technology could be a wakeup call for progressive players to improve


their safety records through digitalization and
automation.

Mental health is becoming destigmatized in
the industry, with many companies taking
tangible steps to support workers, including
risk assessments that cover both physical and
mental health, sharing resources around mental
wellbeing, and offering practical help like trained
peer support.

Post-COVID-19, the use of PPE and worker
wellbeing has become high-priority, with some


construction companies going the extra mile by
providing employees with innovative new PPE
items that not only help keep them safe, but also
enable them to do their jobs more comfortably—
such as 3D printed masks and safety footwear
that helps revitalize blood flow through the legs
and feet and gives the wearer greater energy.[6]

As one would expect, safety is a crucial pillar of
ESG-led performance and part of all ESG ratings
assessments.

Safety training and information exchange are increasingly benefiting from technology and
software that engages staff and empowers workers to communicate risks. Smart devices
like connected wristbands and helmets enable workers to be more proactive in their safety
processes, share information about hazards and potential incidents in real-time, all while
fostering a positive safety culture.”

### Adapting to the needs of a future, diverse workforce

The E&C industry is undergoing rapid change
in its working practices, with a shift away from
traditional, hard-hat, onsite positions towards
technology-related capabilities that are often
performed remotely. At the same time, both
E&C firms and project owners are competing
for scarce talent with companies from virtually
every other sector.

Respondents to the 2023 global survey rank DEI
as the third most important factor determining
future success. An increasing proportion (50
percent, compared to 42 percent in 2021)
cite the importance of diversified workplace
demographics to help address disruption—
the diversity helps introduce new skills to
tackle longstanding project cost and schedule
challenges.

But it will be tough to make these breakthroughs
without the right people, which means doubling

## The great innovation race

What is the role of digital and other innovative technologies in the new construction landscape?


That’s a burning question facing the sector’s
leaders as they ponder how to overcome
continued poor project performance, adopt, safe,
sustainable construction methods, and improve
the quality, efficiency and carbon footprint of
buildings and infrastructure. Tech giants are
both potential collaborators—bringing new and
exciting innovations—as well as competitors,
as they use their data mastery to gain market
share, and also attract the best talent.

Our 2017 Global Construction Survey took a
deep dive into technology and found an industry
embracing building information modeling (BIM),
analytics and project management information
systems (PIMS), just starting to adopt drones,
smart sensors and mobile, with a few bold
innovators exploring 3D printing, machine
learning (ML), virtual reality (VR) and robotic
process automation (RPA).

Fast forward to this year’s survey and
81 percent of respondents from E&C firms say
their organizations have adopted, or are starting
to adopt, mobile platforms (up from 69 percent
in 2017, see Exhibit 15), while 43 percent are
either using or starting to use RPA compared to
just 10 percent in 2017. Meanwhile, take-up of
VR (either using or starting to use) has doubled
from 28 percent to 56 in the same time period.

Accelerating tech adoption

Innovation is a familiar buzzword in board rooms, corporate offices and construction sites, and
some companies have made impressive progress. We’ve seen robotic dogs that “sniff out”
unsafe incidents and practices onsite, capture ongoing construction in three dimensions for
close-to-real-time work measurement, and check design alignment vis-à-vis a 3D model.

Then there’s the project owner organization that ordered out all major packages in record
time, by collectively bargaining with its service providers, shaving precious months off the
implementation schedule. In another example, a prime contractor uses 5D BIM layered
with its custom workflows and internally developed Theory Of Constraints (TOC)-based lean
construction methodology, for a fully integrated concept-to-design-to-delivery approach.

Digital technologies serve as one of the largest levers for owners and E&C firms to implement
innovative ideas and solve project implementation problems. The key is to use a combination
of already available and tested technologies.

In the rush for instant results that yield a positive, short-term ROI, many potential digital
technology investments are overlooked. A 3–5 year horizon is realistic when assessing the
investment case. And don’t underestimate the importance of cultural barriers in both owner
and contractor organizations; a shift in culture is often necessary to drive innovation at
business unit, functional and individual levels, creating a virtuous cycle.

As our survey responses demonstrate, established industry players are deploying PMIS, BIM
and advanced data analytics, and are making inroads into the use of digital twins, AI, VR/AR,
3D printing, RPA. The successful adopters are championing innovation from the very top and
investing in educating their teams. In addition to encouraging digital technology use for project
implementation, management can also apply these technologies to conduct management
reviews and governance, sending a further signal that the organisation is shunning
conventional, manual methods and striving for digital leadership.”

**Suneel Vora, (PMP), Partner, Business Consulting – Capital Projects and Industry 4.0,**

However, a far smaller proportion of
respondents’ companies are applying these
and other technologies across all projects—just
6 percent for RPA, 5 percent for 3D printing,
4 percent for ML and 8 percent for AR. With
a lack of consistent standards across the
industry, the full benefits of such innovations
are some way off.

Another technology growing in popularity is
AI. Since the 2018 Global Construction Survey,
use of AI—in the form of digital twins, smarter
construction equipment, data and document
management, and enhanced safety and
communication—has increased significantly.
In 2018, just 23 percent of respondents said
they were either adopting or just started to
adopt AI. That figure rose to 29 percent in
2021, and climbed to 37 percent in 2023 (see
Exhibit 16). As a measure of how far there is
to go, a mere 4 percent are applying AI across
every project, although 33 percent have
started to use AI on a few projects.

### Making the right technology investment bets


Which technologies have the potential to deliver
the greatest overall return on investment (ROI)
in capital projects? The picture has changed little
since the same question was asked in our 2017
survey, with integrated project management
information systems (PMIS), BIM and advanced
data analytics as the top three responses. These
proven innovations are clearly making their mark,
but the survey findings suggest there is a lot of
untapped potential from newer, emerging tech
such as digital twins, AI, VR/AR, 3D printing,
RPA and—as we will discuss shortly, modular
manufacturing.

The industry’s mixed record of going over budget
and over schedule is something that everyone
involved in construction has been striving to
overcome for decades. So it was fascinating to
hear how the various new technologies were
contributing to cost and schedule performance
improvement, or avoiding overruns.

The technologies that are gaining most
traction are digital twins and modular/offsite
manufacturing, while, AI and RPA appear to be
in early stages of adoption. These responses
suggest that, while some forward-looking
companies are gaining tangible benefits on
project performance metrics, others are failing
to make the best use of technology. They could
benefit from team members with business
process, technology and change management
experience, and individuals who can drive


technology implementations to ensure they
deliver on their approved business cases. This
often requires a structured project management


office (PMO) dedicated to technology
implementation and associated business
processes.

### The stage is set for modular


In their new book “How Big things Get Done[11],”
Bent Flyvbjerg—chair of major programme
management at Oxford University’s Saïd
Business School—and co-author Dan Gardner
present a passionate argument for the benefits
of modular manufacturing, taking construction
from the site to the factory floor, making use
of standardized designs to cut costs, improve
quality and safety, and speed up construction.

Accordingly, 2023 is the first year the Global
Construction Survey has tracked the use of
modular/off-site manufacturing, with onequarter of E&C respondents reporting that they
leverage such an approach across all projects,
and a further 61 percent starting to adopt
on a few projects. More than eight out of 10
(84 percent) of respondents—both owners


and E&C companies—say that prefabrication
is an important solution for capital projects,
suggesting that all parts of the industry should
work together to advance its use.

Looking more closely at the use of modular
manufacturing, a majority (69 percent) apply it
for less than one-fifth of projects (see Exhibit
18). Interestingly, only 28 percent expect to
adopt this technology across more than half
of their projects within five years. Hopes are
high for modular—almost one-third (31 percent)
feel that it has potential to deliver the greatest
ROI. It’s now time for this approach to go
mainstream, to achieve the kind of industry
disruption that other sectors have experienced,
like automotive with electric vehicles (EVs).

### Technology and worker safety


Having worked tirelessly to create a safety-first
culture, E&C companies are turning to more
technical solutions to ensure that workers
don’t come to harm. The most widely used
technologies in this respect are data and
analytics to predict and prevent incidents, and
modular manufacturing, to reduce the volume of
onsite work.


Other advancements that improve safety
include robotics (cited by 8 percent as driving
better safety), remote operated machines (15
percent), drones for monitoring (18 percent) and
smart sensors for notifying high-risk activity or
health concerns (24 percent). These relatively
modest figures indicate significant room for
improvement in use of digital technologies to
meet critical safety KPIs.

## Key takeaways

**Address productivity as a matter of urgency**
By taking an outside-in approach, the E&C industry can learn from the best practices from other
sectors—primarily manufacturing—to gain efficiencies from scale, standardization/ modularity,
and value chain ecosystems. In doing so, project owners and E&C companies can finally make
the kind of productivity gains that have eluded them for so long.

**Master enterprise risk management**
The capability to assess organization-wide risks, across multiple projects, large and small, is
vital in bidding, pricing, and resourcing. A modern E&C company, with a good understanding of
risk interdependence, should have the confidence to say “no” to unprofitable projects and avoid
a race to the bottom, as well as spotting potentially damaging risks earlier and taking decisive
action to prevent project failure.

**Truly embed ESG**
Future leaders spanning the construction sector will likely lead purposeful organizations
that recognize the benefits of sustainable construction, infrastructure, and buildings, along
with sustainable supply chains, diverse workplaces, and strong community ties. A changing
regulatory environment, compounded by heightened expectations from investors, employees,
and customers, has made ESG a business imperative. Failure to prioritize ESG could result
in a negative sustainability profile, reducing access to capital and top talent, further limiting
companies’ ability to keep up with ESG leaders. Lip service to ESG is no longer enough.

**Become data masters**
Those companies that can capture data, analyze it, and produce practical insights will likely enjoy
lower costs, better project performance, greater efficiency, and safer workplaces. They are also
likely to attract a new breed of digital worker who sees exciting opportunities to create the smart,
sustainable buildings and infrastructure of the future.
