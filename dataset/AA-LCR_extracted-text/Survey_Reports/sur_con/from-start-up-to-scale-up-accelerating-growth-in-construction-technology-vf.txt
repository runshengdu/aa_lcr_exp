# From start-up to scale-up: Accelerating growth in construction technology

### To achieve scale, founders, executives, and investors in construction
 technology need to eliminate the barriers to efficient growth. Here’s how.

_by Jose Luis Blanco, David Rockhill, Aditya Sanghvi, and Alberto Torres_


-----

Construction sites in 2023 might in many ways
resemble those in 1923, with manual bricklaying,
paper blueprints, and scaffold towers. At $12 trillion,[1]
architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC)
is one of the biggest industries in the world, but
historically it has been among the slowest to digitize
and innovate.

This, however, is changing fast: strong demand
for infrastructure, a shortage of skilled labor,
and increased stakeholder pressure for data
transparency and integration are all accelerating
digital adoption. As a result, the AEC tech ecosystem
has experienced an explosion of investment and a
wave of start-up launches. An estimated $50 billion
was invested in AEC tech between 2020 to 2022,
85 percent higher than the previous three years.
During the same period, the number of deals in the
industry increased 30 percent to 1,229 (Exhibit 1).

Although the AEC tech industry is maturing, it is not
yet at the scale and sophistication of more established


software markets like logistics, manufacturing, and
agriculture. The industry boasts fewer scale-ups and
unicorns relative to its size. And it is hard for AEC tech
companies to grow efficiently due to several dynamics
among AEC customers, including fragmentation, low
IT spend (relative to other industries), and entrenched
analog ways of working.

In this environment, how can AEC tech companies
accelerate adoption and sales and achieve
scale? To answer this question, we surveyed
approximately 100 investors and AEC tech players
in 2022 and interviewed founders, investors,
and large software companies in the industry.
Using primary research and publicly available
data, we also mapped and analyzed more than
3,000 AEC tech companies.[2] In this article, we
review the findings of that research. We outline
the investment trends that are accelerating the
digitization of the industry, and we suggest how
tech businesses, and their investors, can address
challenges to get on a path of efficient growth.

**Trends accelerating the**
**digitization of AEC**

Digitization of the AEC industry started gathering
steam a decade ago, but the pace has accelerated
over the past three years—and a number of trends
suggest it will continue to do so (see sidebar, “What
do we mean by architecture, engineering, and
construction tech?”).

Economic factors and regulation are
prompting investment
A combination of supply-and-demand factors
are prompting investment in AEC tech. On one
hand, global demand for long-term construction
is strong, in part because of increased stimulus by
governments, such as the $1.2 trillion Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law in the United States and the
€800 billion NextGenerationEU fund in Europe.
More asset owners are also investing sizeable
capital to decarbonize their portfolios to make
them climate resilient. On the other hand, there
is a shortage of skilled workers as more retire or
transition to other industries. The United States
has 440,000 vacancies in AEC, compared with
around 300,000 in 2019, whereas the United
Kingdom’s vacancies have nearly doubled since
2019.[3] The industry is deploying digital technology
to help increase productivity and bridge this gap
between supply and demand.


Meanwhile, regulatory changes aimed at creating a
more connected industry are reinforcing this wave
of digitization. For example, the United Kingdom’s
Building Safety Act requires a digital ledger of all
building data for new residential buildings, and
Sweden’s ID06 requires digital records of all the
construction workers on a construction site.

Investor optimism is high
Investment in AEC tech has grown multifold and,
based on our research, more and more investors are
recognizing AEC tech’s potential to fundamentally
change the structure of the construction industry
and redistribute value pools at scale. This momentum
is likely to continue. Seventy-seven percent of the
respondents to our survey expect to invest in AEC tech
at similar or higher levels in 2023, and 64 percent see it
generating higher returns versus other verticals.

The tech scene is maturing
The proportion of late-stage venture capital in total
AEC tech investment totaled $11.5 billion between
2020 and 2022, more than triple that of the previous
three years (Exhibit 2). Meanwhile, M&A continues
to be the largest source of funding for AEC tech
ventures, accounting for 48 percent of all investments
and 68 percent of all exits. The growth of the industry
is further reflected in the fact that the median deal
size and post-money valuation[4] in the industry has
more than doubled since 2017 (Exhibit 3).

Companies and customers are still
seeking interoperability
In 2020, we observed that AEC tech players
were targeting multiple use cases to address
customer pain points.[5] This trend has continued,
led by customer demand for interoperability—
either through virtual platforms built using open
standards and workflows, such as openBIM, or
with one-stop-shop platforms such as those
developed by some of the largest AEC tech
companies. Indeed, nearly half of the companies
we analyzed offer customers solutions that
address three or more use cases.

AEC technology and property technology
are converging
Until now, AEC tech and property technology
(proptech) have evolved as separate ecosystems.
AEC tech has focused on the design and
construction of assets, while proptech has
focused on the financing, planning, operation, and
maintenance aspects of assets. This is starting to
change, as customers and technology players see
value in connecting the two. Our analysis shows that
20 percent of AEC tech companies also address at
least one proptech use case: for example, linking
the design and operation of building management
systems using a digital twin.

**Hurdles to scale AEC tech**
**investments remain**

While the trends above have helped expand the
ecosystem of AEC-focused tech businesses and
start-ups, investors and founders still wonder how
best to pursue efficient growth—defined as the
ability to grow annual recurring revenues (ARR)
and to generate free cash flow (FCF) from those
revenues.[6] Our analysis across industries shows that
as software companies expand, efficient growth


increasingly correlates strongly with valuations
(Exhibit 4).

Within the AEC technology industry, however, our
research also indicates that efficient growth is
particularly tough to achieve for four reasons:

1. _Customer fragmentation. The average_

construction company employs fewer than ten
people. The average project involves more than
100 different suppliers and subcontractors.
So achieving scale requires selling to a large
number of companies. This means that sales
growth can be labor intensive and slow. As
one investor noted, “This is a risk-averse and
fragmented sector at its core, so growth is slow,
but it is extremely sticky.”

2. _Multiple customer personas. Founders_

frequently tell us that identifying the real
customer is tough because they lack a clear
understanding of user versus buyer personas.
Depending on the project, for example, the
customer could be the project manager, IT
manager, or procurement manager. And often,
purchase decisions are made at the project level,
not the enterprise level. As a result, companies
need to resell the product again to the next
project, which drives down net retention and
raises acquisition costs. As one investor said,
“The most successful companies have a plan to
sell to the enterprise, not just the project.”

3. _Low margins and economic headwinds._

Making the case for spending on software can
be tough for AEC companies when there is
limited capacity for investment. The industry
has low margins and increasing economic
headwinds, including materials cost inflation.
Moreover, the typical IT spend for AEC
companies is 1 to 2 percent of the revenue,


5 “Rise of the platform era: The next chapter in construction technology,” McKinsey, October 30, 2020.
6 Annual recurring revenue is the revenue that a company (often businesses that operate on a subscription-based model) expects to

receive from customers on an annual basis. Free cash flow is the cash generated by a company after paying operating expenses and
capital expenditures.

compared with the 3 to 5 percent average
across industries.[7] Against this backdrop,
solutions must come with a business case.
Although ROI can be high, until recently players
have not been effective at quantifying benefits.
As one investor said, “In a low-margin industry,
and in this market environment in particular,


it is important that companies can clearly
demonstrate and measure the cost-saving
benefits of their product.”


4. _Adoption and scaling challenges. Driving tech_

adoption in a projects business like construction
poses several challenges: users often switch

products among different projects—sometimes
they need to adopt different tools depending
on client preferences, and staff come and go.
Furthermore, the industry has traditionally
had limited digital capabilities, although this is
changing as workers become accustomed to
using digital technology in their everyday lives.
And as one AEC company executive said, “The
pandemic forced us to accelerate adoption from
the office to the site overnight.”

**Strategies for scaling AEC**
**tech businesses**

For companies that can overcome these barriers,
there is a big prize up for grabs: a customer
base that is larger than most other industries.
So what does it take? Our analysis of tech
companies in AEC, as well as other industries
like manufacturing, travel, and logistics, shows
five common growth characteristics.

Pursue a big total addressable
market and a bold vision
As one investor told us, “If the extent of your vision
is to sell tools to solve a niche problem, then we’re
not excited. We are looking for founders with
vision and mission to improve outcomes for big
swathes of the market.” Having a bold vision—and
being able to effectively articulate how it benefits
the user and the broader industry—helps attract
talent, investors, and customers, and allows
companies to move faster as they continually
course-correct toward a North Star. For example,
one AEC tech company focuses on improving
predictability of project outcomes and uses that
simple vision to expand the total addressable
market (TAM) beyond contractors and planners to
cover a far broader customer set, including project
owners, banks, and insurance companies.

A bold vision usually means founders are thinking
about the entire AEC tech ecosystem and
figuring out ways in which their company can
work with other providers to create a seamless
user experience and unlock newfound value for a
broader set of customers. For example, one AEC


design platform expanded its core offering beyond
architects and engineers to connect to product
suppliers, and thus monetize transactions for
building products used in designs.

Achieve a great product market fit
Finding the right product market fit is a key part
of the investment decision-making process
for investors in most industries, but AEC tech
companies often do not get it right. In fact, as
our survey indicates, the most common issues
observed by AEC tech investors are an overfocus on
engineering (rather than product and market fit) and
product fragmentation (Exhibit 5).

As one AEC tech player noted, “Niche, technical
design tools are often built by self-taught developers
and construction professionals who built the tool
to solve a specific problem or fill a gap in their
workflow. As such, the very nature of those tools
focuses on the tech and not the user experience.” In
our discussions with start-ups and investors, three
common themes emerged that can help create a
better product market fit. All three elements require
strong product management capabilities.

First is focus. Since customer needs differ across
segments, companies would do well to focus on
one or a few specific segments, whether they
are targeting architects or subcontractors or
distributors. As one founder put it, “I have potential
customers in manufacturing, retail, construction,
and facilities management across more than ten
geographies, but we have to focus, or we will
achieve nothing.”

Second is feedback. As one investor told us,
“Many contech [construction technology] firms are
founded by industry professionals who launched
their business to solve a problem, so they have huge
product focus. We need to see more founders with a
balanced product and market/customer focus.” One
way to sharpen market focus is to build a network
of customers and collaborators. Most successful
players do this through their investors’ networks
and beta customers, who benefit from low-cost
early releases in return for investment in testing and

development feedback. And a side benefit is that
they can provide access to a critical mass of other
customers (Exhibit 6).

Third is flexibility. Nearly every start-up and scaleup we have spoken to has seen a big shift in their
product proposition because they responded to
market views and kept evolving to optimize the
product market fit. For example, one start-up
developed an app to measure material waste from
construction sites but eventually evolved it to
measure embodied carbon in materials.


Based on our research, leading players differentiate
themselves with three moves to maximize the ARR
bang for each buck spent on marketing and R&D:

— Deliver a scalable revenue model. As one


investor said, “Some products require so much
customization that the software company
becomes a consultancy.” Successful businesses
have a product that can be deployed with
minimal customization and training (and that
usually means software rather than hardware).
And where customization or training is required,
they invest time only in high-potential customers
and often partner with independent software
vendors to deliver at scale.


Build a customer acquisition engine with a
scalable revenue and distribution model
Valuations for start-ups are tied strongly with the
ARR growth metric. In a fragmented market like
AEC, customer acquisition is difficult and expensive.

time. Successful players use their investors
and existing customers to open new routes
to market. They also lock in users early. For
example, one design software player gave
away free copies of its software to architecture
students, who then took it to their new
employers. Moreover, these players have
a channel strategy aligned with customer
tiers, and that includes not only value-added
resellers (VARs) and distributors but also lowcost remote channels (including multilingual
remote inside-sales centers) and self-serve,
web shop, and e-commerce.


its go to market across brands to accelerate
cross-sell and upsell and capped bonuses on
some established products to incentivize sales
of new products. The best sales organizations
are underpinned by data that allows them to
see the relationship between specific, often
siloed, sales and marketing activities and
overall growth outcomes.

Improve net retention with customer success
Our analysis shows that as software companies
grow, the most important driver of valuation shifts
from pure growth, often measured by ARR, to
include the ability to generate FCF from ARR.
In short, it’s not enough to just have customers;
you need to earn money from them. In what is
commonly referred to as the “rule of 40,” the sum of
percentage growth and the FCF rate should equal
40 percent or higher.[8]

software companies incentivize their directsales teams to cross-sell and upsell and drive

## As software companies grow beyond the start-up and scale-up stages, growth rates slow, and free cash flow
 (and hence, valuation) is increasingly
 driven by operational efficiency.


Achieving strong FCF is in large part about optimizing
the payback period—that is, how long does it take
to recover your customer acquisition costs. This
means acquiring new customers efficiently, retaining
customers, and upselling and cross-selling to them.
This is measured by net retention rate (NRR),[9] which
requires a laser focus on customer success. Across
sectors, companies with high NRRs demonstrate
three common characteristics:

— They know their numbers. At the heart

of customer success is a data-driven
understanding of how customers obtain
value from a specific product. Maximizing
NRR is a game of inches, so leaders analyze
the many drivers of growth and churn (upsell,
contract cancellation, additional licenses, and
so on) at a customer level and respond with
targeted interventions (for example, offering
bundles for additional “seats” as usage reaches
contract limits).

— They set up a dedicated customer success

_function. A team that can work with customers_
to get maximum value from the product is
particularly important in AEC, where customers
are less digitally mature and solutions are less


well established. For example, the largest AEC
technology companies have customer success
teams and run conferences and training for
their users. One software company hired a
retired construction contractor for its customer
success function to better understand
customer needs.

— They deliver customer success at low

_cost. Customer success does not have to_
mean dedicated (and expensive) customer
support. It can often be delivered at lower
cost by cultivating user communities and
promoting the use of online tutorials, for
example. One AEC tech company gained
thousands of users on zero-marketing spend
by leveraging its community forums and
industry networks—effectively putting its own
customers to work.

Build functional maturity as you scale
As software companies grow beyond the start-up
and scale-up stages, growth rates slow, and FCF
(and hence, valuation) is increasingly driven by
operational efficiency. This typically comes down
to optimizing NRR as well as marketing and sales
spend (which can be 50 percent or more of the

revenues of typical software companies). At-scale
software companies in the top quartile for valuation
typically exhibit the following characteristics[10]:

— Optimize marketing and sales spend. Leading

software players allocate marketing and
sales spend against future, not past, revenue
opportunities to give high-growth accounts
the biggest coverage. They also continuously
segment customers, targeting lower-potential
customers through web sales/e-commerce
and inside sales while increasing spend on the
highest-potential customers.

— Continuously optimize pricing and track

_impact. Leading players build customer_
business cases to link pricing to the value
generated for customers. They also track the
impact of pricing changes in near real time and
optimize accordingly. Companies would also do
well to make sure their payment terms are right.
As one investor explained, AEC tech players
often price based on a project or milestone.
“This is not ARR, even though some may call it
that. And because construction is often subject
to delays, this means the risk attached to these
revenue streams is very high, which puts off
potential investors.”


— Lean on data and automate processes.

Successful software companies leverage
data, AI, and automated processes across
the business in a variety of ways, including
identifying leads and proactively targeting
cross-sell and upsell opportunities, leveraging
usage information in pricing and product
decisions, and assessing developer velocity.

— Strengthen the business-building muscle.

Tech companies of every size often reach the
tip of a growth curve without a market-ready
venture or offering that can pick up the slack,
so their growth dips. Leading players maintain
momentum by launching net-new businesses
more quickly. They incubate new businesses
thoughtfully, with dedicated resourcing for
product development and go to market.

Several tailwinds are powering growth in the AEC
tech industry despite the near-term challenges
of the economic slowdown. To capitalize on the
investment opportunities and achieve efficient
growth, investors and tech companies can learn
from the most successful AEC tech companies and
catch the wave in this exciting industry.
