## The future of work  is now


-----

### Executive summary

Technological, economic and geopolitical forces are driving transformative shifts in both work and place. We identify five trends shaping

the modern workplace and address their critical implications for the future of work.


**Good employee experience wins the war for talent.**

We highlight the importance of a seamless employee

experience across various domains, including HR,

skilling and workplace management. Understanding

employee motivation and efficiency drives changes to

business processes and becomes a key differentiator

in talent acquisition.

**Virtual is the new real. The COVID-19 pandemic**

accelerated the shift to virtual work, making technology

central to maintaining employee engagement. Virtual

collaboration tools, inclusive communication and a

culture that reflects organisational values are crucial

for a connected global workforce.

**Net zero as standard. The trend of making “net zero”**

a standard parameter for services reflects a growing

emphasis on environmental sustainability. The adoption

of advanced technologies and processes is key to

achieving net-zero goals and aligning with the values

of a diverse workforce.


**Trust corporations to enable privacy. Trusting**

corporations with personal information, including privacy

and security measures, becomes essential. Privacy

concerns impact employee engagement, and organisations

need to prioritise privacy to build trust.

**Loving your AI advisor. The integration of AI advisors**

as personalised and empathetic entities signals a turning

point in the concept of work, with employees becoming

attached to their workplace AI advisors. This aligns with

the broader theme of technology as a collaborative

partner, contributing to a more productive and innovative

work environment.

In the backdrop of these trends, we emphasise the challenges

and complexities of digitising continually moving and evolving

workspaces. We discuss the need for a strategic and integrated

approach to balance technology, human experience and external

factors, providing implementation suggestions. Furthermore,

the shift from a singular focus on value to considering diverse

values within the modern workplace is highlighted, emphasising

the importance of understanding unique industry dynamics,

organisational cultures and individual perspectives. We call for a

deeper perspective on people and cultural change within value

flows, advocating for an integrated approach beyond short-term

technology standardisation.


Embracing potential: A deep dive into modern workplace trends

### Embracing potential: A deep dive into modern workplace trends

Driven by technological, economic and geopolitical factors, both

work and place are changing dramatically.

Five key trends are emerging for the modern workplace. As

organisations navigate dynamic socioeconomic landscapes and

experience the impact of digitisation, they are compelled to

redefine their workplaces. From the rise of remote collaboration

to the integration of cutting-edge technologies, we unravel the

nuanced threads of the emerging workplace.

### Good employee experience wins the war  for talent

Employee services will grow together between HR, skilling,

employee care, (virtual) site services and workplace management.

The most attractive companies will provide an employ experience

that merges interfaces, processes and communication styles,

from centralised attention management to interlacing corporate

and private demand automatically. Having the best AI advisor will

become a differentiator in hiring, as it will make the employee

experience seamless and easy.

Recognising and addressing the erosion of employee
engagement is paramount. Employers require strategies
that foster positive work environments, encourage
open communication and provide opportunities for
professional growth.


Addressing talent challenges requires a multifaceted approach.

Organisations must proactively respond to technological

advancements, changing demographics and shifts in market

demand. Recognising and addressing the erosion of employee

engagement is paramount. Employers require strategies that foster

positive work environments, encourage open communication and

provide opportunities for professional growth.

Employee disengagement is a global concern with far-reaching

consequences. Employers need global strategies to enhance

engagement, considering cultural nuances and individual needs

to create a unified and motivated workforce. Acknowledging the

changing nature of work is essential, as is providing technology
enabled flexibility, redefining traditional work structures and

cultivating an environment that adapts to the diverse needs and

expectations of modern talent.

People gravitate to employers that offer the best end-to-end

employee experience. This drives loyalty, productivity and optimal

business outcomes. Leveraging technology strategically is vital for


attracting and retaining talent. This includes tools that enhance

collaboration, improve remote work capabilities and provide a

seamless digital experience, while addressing potential challenges

related to digital fatigue and over-reliance on technology.

Prioritising employee well-being through a comprehensive

approach to workplace care is integral. This includes promoting

work–life balance and mental health support and fostering a

culture of empathy in which people feel valued.

To create a successful employee experience, companies must have

both a plan to implement and the capability to steer themselves

effectively on the journey by measuring meaningful and relevant

outcomes. A developed product or service concept with an end-to
end implementation plan is a rarity that sets market leaders apart.

Measuring the outcomes of employee experience implementations

is complex, and the measurement of employee satisfaction

continues to evolve conceptually, as do all other aspects of

employee experience.

### Virtual is the new real

The COVID-19 pandemic led us down a path towards a different

work style. It enabled global collaboration, albeit in a form lacking

in terms of privacy and scope. Soon, realistic-looking avatars will

project images of ourselves, and the virtual coffee pot will be the

norm. Corporations have an opportunity to lead or lag here, as

people will use these tools, regardless — and in the process, they’ll

open a variety of doors through which corporate information can

be leaked.

In a virtual work setting, maintaining employee engagement

is critical. As physical distance grows, organisations must use

virtual tools and strategies to foster a sense of connection,

collaboration and shared purpose. Addressing the erosion of

engagement requires innovative approaches to virtual team

building, communication and recognition. Understanding the global

impact of engagement emphasises the need for virtual platforms

that transcend geographical boundaries. Virtual collaboration

tools, inclusive communication and a virtual culture that values

engagement contribute to a more connected and productive global

workforce. These enable truly global teams that embrace diversity

and inclusion, though they also raise the importance of establishing

supporting corporate global values and policies.

In a virtual-centric environment, technology plays a leading role.

Embracing virtual reality, collaboration platforms and advanced

communication tools becomes imperative. The modern workplace

relies on technology to enhance productivity and facilitate seamless

virtual interaction, reinforcing the notion that virtual is the new real.

Effectively managing a diverse virtual workforce demands nuanced

approaches tailored to a wide array of user needs. This underscores


the importance of comprehending and accommodating diverse

perspectives, cultural nuances and individual requirements within

the virtual realm. Meeting the demands of a modern workforce

requires virtual tools that are both inclusive and accessible. These

tools must facilitate the sharing of personality and interests

in a manner that is abstract yet personal. Embracing these

comprehensive strategies promotes inclusion and enhances the

overall functionality of virtual collaboration. It also ensures the tools

employed mirror the diversity of today’s professional landscape.

Balancing values and value in a virtual context entails harmonising

corporate and organisational values with the dynamics of the

virtual work environment. This involves cultivating a virtual culture

that mirrors and promotes the organisation’s values while ensuring

that virtual work contributes tangible value to both employees and

the business. It underscores the imperative to seamlessly integrate

values into virtual practices.

Recognising the inevitability of a virtual future positions
companies to embrace change proactively and navigate
the landscape successfully.

As we transition to the workplace of the future, continual

adaptation to emerging technologies, evolving employee

expectations and the dynamic nature of virtual collaboration

become paramount. Recognising the inevitability of a virtual

future positions companies to embrace change proactively and

navigate the landscape successfully. Companies must establish

new performance management and financial models that

incentivise change and enable individual and collective ownership

of outcomes. Success lies in transforming resistance to change into

### Trust corporations to enable privacy

Personal IT security is becoming increasingly complex. In parallel,

we are using a growing volume of connected devices that are all

potentially vulnerable. We trust our corporations to provide a safe

work environment. We trust them with healthcare and IT security.

Why not trust them to help us secure our personal data as well,

giving employers one additional reason to win the war for talent?

In an increasingly complex world, even technology specialists

cannot completely secure all personal data. This raises questions of

trust and employee assistance in securing privacy and private data.

Employers have a valid level of self-interest in data security, as

does every individual challenged with juggling privacy and security.

Global cloud, software and service providers are perceived as

having an interest in personal data. In an environment lacking

in trust and stability, employers have the opportunity to set

themselves apart by providing corporate data services and

including privacy-related capabilities as part of the employment

packages they offer. Privacy is a fundamental aspect of employee

engagement. Facing the erosion of engagement involves

addressing concerns related to data privacy. When employees

trust that their privacy is respected, it positively impacts their

engagement levels.

The evolving nature of work requires redefining what constitutes

work. Trusting corporations with the privacy of remote and flexible

work arrangements becomes central to this shift. Acknowledging

and addressing privacy concerns reflects the changing landscape of

work and the need for responsible privacy practices.


### Loving your AI advisor

Your chatbot transcends mere functionality; it becomes personal

and capable of empathy. With a personalised AI-generated

appearance that can be customised, it becomes an omnipresent

companion. Whether enhancing productivity or sparking creativity,

it is continuously present, adapting to an array of work areas.

AI-based advisors have seamlessly integrated into our evolving

work environment. Some operate discreetly behind processes

while others take on explicit roles. The immediate future promises

a competitive landscape of AI advisors spanning many technical

niches, from workplace and desktop support to HR and process

engines. Their evolution is marked by the shift to increasing

personalisation. Capabilities extend beyond mere chat to include

visual presence.

The next competitive frontier revolves around customisation.

Users can tailor an AI advisor’s appearance, search and answer

parameters, communication style, and even personality,

encompassing language style, origin and mood. The key question

of preference arises, with the focus shifting from ease of use to

the more nuanced criteria of comfort of use and pleasure of use.

Users will likely model their AI advisors on idealised versions of

themselves, celebrities or significant individuals in their lives.

Imagine an AI advisor with a familiar and likeable appearance,

who is always ready to assist and contributes seamlessly to your

work. As this narrative evolves, companies are urged to choose AI

advisors based on their potential to elicit affection from employees.

This goes beyond functionality; when employees genuinely like

their AI advisors, ease of use increases and internal change

management overhead decreases.


The increasing focus on privacy aligns with the growing recognition

that people need to trust their employers with their personal

information. Organisations that prioritise robust privacy measures

build trust and credibility with their people.

A diverse workforce brings varied privacy expectations. Assessing

and respecting the privacy needs of a diverse workforce aligns with

the trend of trusting companies to customise privacy measures

based on individual needs, thereby fostering a culture of inclusion

and respect.

A culture of leaders encompasses ethical leadership, including

responsible handling of employee data. Trusting corporations

to prioritise privacy reflects a leadership commitment to ethical

practices, building a culture where employees feel secure and

confident in their leadership’s commitment to privacy


-----

The central role of AI advisors in the modern workplace cannot

be overstated. The capacity for employees to embrace and

form attachments to these digital companions emphasises their

significance in enhancing efficiency, providing valuable insights

and streamlining tasks. This underscores the theme of technology

as a valuable workplace partner contributing to an increasingly

productive and innovative work environment. The interplay

between personalised AI advisors and human experience will

reshape the landscape of the future workplace.

The use of AI in the workplace is redefining traditional
notions of work by introducing new modes of support,
collaboration and decision-making.

As the concept of work undergoes transformation, the integration

of AI advisors reflects a turning point. The use of AI in the

workplace is redefining traditional notions of work by introducing

new modes of support, collaboration and decision-making. Liking

your AI advisor aligns with this turning point, emphasising a

positive and collaborative relationship between humans and AI in

the evolving landscape of work.

Assessing the needs of a diverse workforce includes recognising

different preferences and work styles. When people like their AI

advisors, this signifies an ability to create AI personalities that

resonate with diverse individuals and consider cultural sensitivities

and personal preferences. Well-designed AI advisors play a role in

fostering a workplace culture of inclusion and acceptance.


-----

### Value — which way is up?

Gravity is shifting as the focus moves from value to values. Every

industry is different, every organisation is different, and every

person is different.

Understanding value flows is critical in the modern workplace,

marking a shift from a singular focus on value to a broader

consideration of values. Recognising the uniqueness of each

industry, organisation and person is paramount in understanding

the diverse elements that influence the workplace. By

comprehending how values intersect and influence the flow of

value, organisations can optimise processes, enhance collaboration

and align with evolving expectations. This nuanced understanding

is pivotal for achieving business outcomes that resonate with the

diverse stakeholders involved in the modern business ecosystem.


### Action: The rest is rhetoric

The modern workplace is shaped by key themes and actions that

define its trajectory.

First, the vital role of trust is emphasised as the cornerstone of

transformation. Trust fosters collaboration, encourages innovation

and enables the workforce to embrace change confidently.

Second, hyper-personalisation emerges as a crucial consideration,

with the recognition that tailoring experiences for both employees

and customers is imperative. This customisation improves

satisfaction and engagement.

Third, the core role of security takes a long-term perspective.

Acknowledging its fundamental importance is safeguarding

sensitive data and maintaining a resilient workplace infrastructure.

Fourth, modernising the workplace is a leadership journey. It

involves strategic decision-making, adapting to technological

advancements and unlocking the full potential of talent. This

process not only enhances organisational efficiency but also

propels growth and innovation.

Transitioning to the workplace of the future will require conscious

and proactive change, transparent corporate governance, and

a clearly articulated corporate change and evolution strategy,

enabled via a robust plan with clear goals and supported by

corporate enterprise architecture. The commitment to execution

must be embraced throughout the organisation, with collective

CXO ownership.


In summary, the key calls to action for the modern workplace

revolve around trust, hyper-personalisation, security and

leadership-driven modernisation. These considerations collectively

shape a dynamic, adaptable and employee-centric work environment

that is pivotal for sustained success in the business landscape.

requires a robust technological infrastructure, a comprehensive

understanding of user data privacy considerations, and ethical

practices in handling sensitive information. When effectively

deployed, hyper-personalisation enhances employee satisfaction,

engagement and productivity by creating a workplace experience

tailored to individuals’ unique needs.

organisation’s commitment to staying relevant, competitive and

responsive to the changing dynamics of the business environment.

It involves a comprehensive approach that considers technology,

culture and organisational practices to create a modern and

adaptive workplace.
