strategy now and in the future.

##### Trends in Digital Marketing Strategy

Companies’ approach to digital marketing is in a constant state of change. On an annual or even

quarterly basis, companies put their strategy under a microscope to make sure their efforts are aligned

with their organizational and business goals.

**To get a glimpse into the state of digital marketing, we turned to our clients to find out how they**

**envision their digital marketing spend changing in the next year, what their biggest pain points**

**are, and what their biggest goals are.**

Overall, our client base doesn’t expect to decrease

spending on digital marketing efforts in the next year

— nearly half are planning to spend more to build on

the work we’re doing and put even more weight behind

their efforts. This isn’t surprising considering that

revenue growth is clients’ biggest goal and investing

in cutting-edge, strategy-backed, tailored digital

marketing efforts is a surefire way to close more

business and boost the bottom line.

Our clients are also focused on improving their

positioning in search results, attracting more

website traffic, building brand awareness and

thought leadership, and generating more leads

(and more qualified leads).

##### Can’t-Miss Content Marketing Trends

In 2024, the content marketing landscape continues to evolve at a steady clip. Staying ahead in this

dynamic field means understanding and leveraging the latest trends. Below are five key trends that are

revolutionizing the reach and impact of content marketing:

**1. AI-GENERATED CONTENT IMPROVES EFFICIENCY, BUT HUMAN TOUCH IS**
**ESSENTIAL.**

[Gartner predicts that by 2025, 30% of outbound marketing](https://www.gartner.com/en/articles/beyond-chatgpt-the-future-of-generative-ai-for-enterprises)

**[messages from large organizations will be generated with](https://www.gartner.com/en/articles/beyond-chatgpt-the-future-of-generative-ai-for-enterprises)** 30%

the help of AI, up from just 2% in 2022. This demonstrates

a shift toward AI-generated content, enabling brands to

produce high volumes of personalized, engaging material.

AI tools are not only enhancing efficiency, but also playing

a crucial role in content strategy and execution. And thanks

to custom GPTs, it’s getting easier to create AI-generated

content that’s tailored to specific people, brands, or product LARGE ORGANIZATIONS WILL BE AI

**“AI will continue to be a tool in our collective tool kit to pull from as needed, but it should never fully**

**replace a human’s touch. It will have big positive impacts on making things more efficient and easier,**

**but even within that, we will see why AI shouldn’t take over as the only option. There has to be a person**

**involved to guide the AI, check the AI, and ultimately use human emotions that AI isn’t capable of.”**

**— KATIE SANDERS, SENIOR EDITOR, BLACK & WHITE ZEBRA AND THE CTO CLUB**

**2. QUICK, IMPACTFUL MESSAGING CATERS TO OUR FAST-MOVING REALITY.**

According to our deep dive into more than 100,000 pieces of online content, the average word

count of the most-shared content was 551.8 — much lower than the previous year’s average word

count of 792. One factor is that readers are strapped for time and have more content than ever vying

for their attention. If content isn’t easy to consume, readers might bounce to another resource — and

they’re less likely to share it. There’s also the rise in AI to consider. AI-generated content is often on

the shorter side, so we might see shorter content for a time as more people start using AI to help

with content production. But as content creators get better at marrying AI and human insights, the

content may trend longer again.

**3. PUBLICATIONS ARE LOOKING TO ENGAGE THEIR AUDIENCES WITH A VARIETY**
**OF TYPES OF CONTENT.**

Written content is incredibly effective and easily scalable — but it’s not the only way audiences enjoy

consuming content. So publication editors are looking to publish a variety of content types this year. When

we asked what other forms of media publication editors plan to publish in 2024, here’s what they said:


###### 27%


TWITTER/SLACK

###### 21%

###### 6%

CHATS

PODCASTS


OTHER


WEBINARS


INFOGRAPHICS


###### 35%


###### 47%


VIDEOS


NEWSLETTERS


###### 41%


###### 41%


If you’re hoping to include guest posts in your content marketing strategy, consider how you could

incorporate videos or infographics into your content to capture publication editors’ attention — and

their readers’.

**4. INTERACTIVE AND IMMERSIVE EXPERIENCES ENGAGE AUDIENCES.**

Text-based content is a great way to share information, reach your target audience, and rise the ranks

of search results, but more and more marketers are adding interactive content into the mix to engage

[their audience. In fact, interactive content results in 52.6% higher engagement than static content, and](https://www.mediafly.com/blog/state-of-interactive-content-in-2022/)

visitors spend about 13 minutes engaging with interactive content.

**5. USER-GENERATED CONTENT BUILDS AUTHENTICITY AND TRUST.**

**[Ninety percent of consumers prefer that brands share](https://www.entribe.com/news/new-entribe-survey-reveals-user-generated-content-impacts-consumer-purchases-more-than-social-media-influencers)**

content from actual customers. Content that comes from

users’ perspective builds trust with consumers because

they’re getting a glimpse at how the product or service

might impact their lives. WHEN BRANDS SHARE CONTENT

##### Emerging Trends in Amazon Marketing

[Amazon’s stature as the world’s largest online retailer and e-commerce platform is unchallenged.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/274255/market-share-of-the-leading-retailers-in-us-e-commerce/)

Considering the sheer volume of listings on Amazon, to excel in this space, brands must go beyond

simply listing products — they must employ strategic marketing efforts to stand out from the pack. As

we step into 2024, here are five main trends shaping Amazon marketing that you should consider as

you execute your strategy:

**1. WE’RE SEEING INCREASED INVESTMENT IN AMAZON ADVERTISING.**

In 2023, our clients increased their spend on Amazon ads by an average of 18% compared to 2022. This

uptick in advertising investment is crucial for brands looking to enhance their visibility and attract more

customers on this competitive platform. With more resources allocated to Amazon ads, brands have

greater opportunities to reach their target audience and convert them into customers.

**2. AMAZON SELLER CENTRAL IS THE DOMINANT CHANNEL FOR SELLING ON**
**AMAZON.**

[Approximately 70% of Amazon sellers use Amazon](https://www.junglescout.com/amazon-seller-report/)

Seller Central, with 30% using Amazon Vendor

**Central and 7% using both. The disparity comes**

mainly because Vendor Central is invite-only. 70% 30% 7%

However, both options have their benefits. We

anticipate that as the market gets more saturated,

we will see even more growth in Seller Central and SELLER VENDOR

equally steady growth in brands that use both options

for flexibility.

SELLER VENDOR

**3. SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETING IS ESSENTIAL TO BUILD AWARENESS OF AMAZON**
**PRODUCTS.**

[In addition to using strategies like Google Ads, branding, and website optimization, 41% of sellers now](https://www.junglescout.com/amazon-seller-report/)

market their products on social media, a 15% increase from the previous year. This growth indicates

a pivotal shift toward cross-platform marketing strategies. By promoting Amazon products on social

media, sellers are tapping into broader audiences and driving additional traffic to their Amazon listings.


-----

**4. INNOVATIVE AI-DRIVEN IMAGERY CAN HELP BRANDS STAND OUT AND PIQUE**
**CONSUMERS’ INTEREST.**

[Amazon’s release of an AI image generator represents a major advancement in product visualization.](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-titan-image-generator-multimodal-embeddings-and-text-models-are-now-available-in-amazon-bedrock/)

Amazon Titan Image Generator enables content creators to swiftly produce studio-quality, lifelike images in

large volumes at a low cost, using simple English language prompts. It’s capable of understanding complex

instructions and generating relevant images, thanks to its training on a diverse, high-quality dataset.

**5. PRIME BIG DEAL DAYS IS LIKELY HERE TO STAY; WEEKLY RESTOCK LIMITS AND**
**QUARTERLY STORAGE VOLUME LIMITS ARE OUT.**

Amazon’s Prime Big Deal Days event saw immense success, with purchases from third-party sellers

[surpassing 150 million items. Additionally, the removal of weekly restock limits and quarterly storage](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/12/amazon-says-october-prime-day-outpaces-last-years-event.html)

volume limits, replaced with a monthly capacity limit, offers sellers more flexibility in managing inventory.

These developments are indicative of Amazon’s evolving marketplace dynamics and the growing

importance of timely and strategic participation in sales events.


-----

##### Developments in Paid Advertising

Paid media continues to experience growth. In our client base alone, we saw average ad spend increase

**by 10% from 2022 to 2023. So as more and more digital marketers tap into the power of paid advertising,**

what trends should they keep in mind?

**1. PAID ADVERTISING IS UNDERGOING**
**AI-DRIVEN TRANSFORMATION.**

AI is leaving no stone unturned as it impacts

every facet of the digital marketing space,

and that includes paid advertising. Google’s

Performance Max ad platform now incorporates

generative AI, revolutionizing ad creation with

rapid text and image customization. Despite

AI’s growing role, human oversight ensures

policy compliance. Google’s Demand Gen and

Video View campaigns harness AI to connect

businesses and consumers more effectively,

offering valuable performance insights for

smarter campaign decisions. And Meta’s

introduction of AI-powered tools, including AI

Sandbox and upgraded Meta Advantage suite

features, is poised to significantly enhance ad

process efficiency and business performance.

**2. THIRD-PARTY COOKIES ARE**
**BEING PHASED OUT.**

Another development in the paid media

space is the continued conversation around

Google phasing out third-party cookies in

Chrome. Cookies have been used to enable

advertisers to track users across websites

so they can serve up targeted ads, but this

level of tracking raises privacy concerns. So

marketers need to prepare for upcoming

changes in 2024, including more reliance on

fi t t d t d AI l ith


-----

**3. CONTEXTUAL TARGETING IS ON THE RISE.**

With the phasing out of third-party cookies, there’s an increasing focus on contextual targeting in paid

[advertising. In 2023, global spending on contextual advertising was estimated at $227.38 billion, and it is](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1289038/contextual-advertising-spending-worldwide/)

[projected to surpass $562.1 billion by 2030, indicating strong market growth and adoption. Notably, 42%](https://www.silverpush.co/guide/contextual-advertising-optimal-targeting-method-for-high-roi-and-less-ad-waste/)

**[of brands planned to increase their spending on contextual ads in 2023, illustrating its potential in the](https://www.silverpush.co/guide/contextual-advertising-optimal-targeting-method-for-high-roi-and-less-ad-waste/)**

changing digital landscape.

Contextual targeting involves placing ads based on the content of a website or a page rather than relying

on user history. This trend is gaining traction as a privacy-friendly alternative to third-party cookies,

allowing advertisers to align their messages with relevant content environments. This shift is pivotal in

addressing privacy concerns while maintaining the effectiveness of digital advertisements.

**4. YOUTUBE IS UNDERGOING AN ADVERTISING EVOLUTION.**

YouTube Shorts have been rolled out to more advertisers who can now choose Short ads as a video

format, integrate them with in-stream ads, and combine them with in-feed ads. What’s more, Google

Ads launched a new feature to help advertisers optimize their YouTube advertising campaigns. Creative

Guidance leverages AI to evaluate content and offer feedback to ensure your campaigns are as effective

as possible. These new capabilities will continue to shape the YouTube advertising space this year.

**5. VOICE SEARCH ADVERTISING IS GAINING MOMENTUM.**

[An estimated 8.4 billion voice assistants will be](https://www.demandsage.com/voice-search-statistics/)

used by the end of 2024, a significant increase from

##### Transformation in the SEO Space


In 2023, our digital marketing agency successfully helped clients achieve 1,188,533 first-page rankings, and

as we step into 2024, we’re embracing the wave of transformations in the SEO landscape to work toward

even more SEO success. Here are five main trends shaping the future of digital marketing in SEO that you

should keep an eye on:

**1. GENERATIVE AI IS RESHAPING THE WAY MARKETERS CREATE CONTENT.**

[According to Deloitte research, 26% of marketers were already using generative AI for content creation](https://www.deloittedigital.com/us/en/insights/perspective/genai-press-release.html)

as of 2023, with an additional 45% planning to do so by the end of 2024. This significant adoption rate

highlights the growing importance and impact of generative AI in digital marketing.

But marketers shouldn’t give AI free rein. While Google doesn’t specifically penalize AI-generated

content simply because it is created by AI, Google’s approach to content (AI-generated or otherwise) is

primarily focused on the value it provides to users. Google’s guidelines and algorithm updates emphasize

the importance of creating content that is helpful, informative, and designed for a human audience

rather than just to rank well in search engines.

**2. GOOGLE BARD TAKES OFF AS A NEW PLAYER IN SEARCH.**

Google Bard, which launched in beta in February 2023 and was made generally available in May, hit

**[142.6 million visits in May, up 187.2% from the previous month. The adoption of Bard is building Google’s](https://www.similarweb.com/blog/insights/ai-news/chatgpt-bard/)**

credibility in the generative AI space as it continues to work toward incorporating those capabilities into

its search engine and other Google products.


-----

**LONG HAUL.**

[Despite previous beliefs in deleting old content just because it’s old, Google emphasizes the value of older, high-](https://searchengineland.com/google-warns-against-content-pruning-as-cnet-deletes-thousands-of-pages-430509)

quality content. This shift in perspective is crucial for SEO strategies, as it encourages marketers to create timeless

content that remains relevant and useful over time. While some content pruning can be beneficial, deleting swathes

[of old content for the sake of deleting old content isn’t beneficial for SEO.](https://twitter.com/searchliaison/status/1689018769782476800)

**“Are you deleting content from your site because you somehow believe Google doesn’t like ‘old’**

**content? That’s not a thing! Our guidance doesn’t encourage this. Older content can still be helpful,**

**too.”**

**— DANNY SULLIVAN, PUBLIC LIAISON FOR SEARCH, GOOGLE**

**4. THE SWITCH FROM UNIVERSAL ANALYTICS TO GOOGLE ANALYTICS 4 WILL**
**CONTINUE TO ENHANCE SEO STRATEGIES.**

GA4 represents a significant shift from UA in terms of data collection, processing, and reporting. It’s designed to provide

a more comprehensive understanding of user behavior across platforms and devices. GA4 offers new capabilities in

understanding user behavior, which is essential for refining SEO strategies to align with evolving user preferences.

**5. GOOGLE’S ALGORITHMIC**
**UPDATES WILL CONTINUE TO**
**SHAPE THE INDUSTRY.**

Google’s algorithm updates, including the

Helpful Content Update and the expansion

of the Reviews Update, underscore the

importance of creating genuine, user-centric

content. These updates reflect Google’s

commitment to enhancing the search

experience by prioritizing content that truly

benefits users and provides clear value

to them.

##### Influencer Marketing Shifts to Follow

As we navigate through 2024, the landscape of influencer marketing continues to evolve, demanding

more than just traditional approaches. With the digital space crowded with myriad voices and content,

brands must adopt innovative and strategic methods to distinguish themselves. Here are five key trends

in influencer marketing that are critical to understand and integrate into your strategy this year:

**1. AFFILIATE MARKETING AND INFLUENCER MARKETING ARE BECOMING MORE**
**INTEGRATED.**

[In 2023, 42% of brands structured their influencer marketing](https://influencermarketinghub.com/influencer-marketing-benchmark-report/)

payments like affiliate marketing payments, meaning they paid

influencers a percentage of the sales that resulted from influencer

marketing. This convergence of affiliate and influencer marketing

is incentivizing influencers to generate results-driven content.

This approach benefits brands, by not having to pay inflated rates

OF BRANDS PAID and by potentially seeing greater ROI, and consumers, by making
OF RESULTING SALES shopping more convenient through affiliate links shared by

influencers.

###### 42%

INFLUENCERS A PERCENTAGE

**2. LIVE SHOPPING IS GAINING MOMENTUM.**

Live shopping, or live commerce, is playing a greater role in

influencer marketing campaigns, particularly on platforms

like Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok. Influencers are using live

video and interactive content to promote products, with some

consumers starting to prefer live-stream shopping over other

types of social media purchases.

Across all generations of consumers in the U.S. who have

participated in live shopping, the “buy now, pay later” service

is the most important feature that determines whether

consumers will participate. “Buy now, pay later” is particularly

[important to Gen X consumers — 62% of them say this](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1344054/top-features-of-online-video-shopping-by-generation/)

service was the most significant factor when determining

their participation in the live shopping event.


-----

**3. LONG-TERM PARTNERSHIPS ARE OVERTAKING ONE-OFF PROJECTS.**

When it comes to influencer marketing

[campaigns, 79% of influencers want long-](https://www.fohr.co/blog/79-percent-of-influencers-want-long-term-partnerships-but-what-about-brands)

**4. TIKTOK INFLUENCER MARKETING SPEND IS ON THE RISE.**

TikTok continues to draw significant ad dollars, with spending on TikTok influencer marketing expected

[to exceed $1.3 billion this year. This trend is driven by the platform’s growing user base — the platform](https://www.martechcube.com/glewee-releases-influencer-marketing-trends-for-smbs-in-2024/#:~:text=TikTok's%20influencer%20marketing%20spend%20is,significant%20role%20in%20digital%20marketing.)

shopping.

**5. INFLUENCERS ARE BECOMING MORE SPECIALIZED.**

The era of depending exclusively on mass-market influencers boasting millions of followers has passed.

In the constantly changing realm of the creator economy, niche communities have risen to prominence,

serving as potent drivers for fostering relationships

between brands and communities. Content from these

micro-influencers often achieves higher engagement

rates than content from macro-influencers, particularly

[on TikTok. On the platform, active engagement](https://thumbstopper.com/resources/blog/the-massive-impact-of-micro-influencers/) 18% 5%

##### Video Marketing Trends to Boost Your Strategy

As we move into 2024, video marketing continues to evolve, presenting new opportunities and challenges

for brands. Let’s explore the five key trends that are reshaping this landscape:

**1. INTERACTIVE VIDEO EXPERIENCES ARE REDEFINING VIDEO MARKETING**
**STRATEGIES.**

The integration of interactive elements in video content, like clickable hotspots and Q&A sessions, is

[redefining viewer engagement and marketing effectiveness. In fact, 87.7% of marketers and business](https://www.spielcreative.com/interactive-video-statistics/)

**[leaders who incorporated interactive video into their sales strategy saw growth in online sales. As a result,](https://www.spielcreative.com/interactive-video-statistics/)**

**86.2% plan to create more videos with interactive elements in the future.**

**2. AI-POWERED VIDEO CREATION IS ON THE RISE.**

The integration of AI-driven scriptwriting and editing tools in video content creation has had a significant

[impact on enhancing engagement and personalization. In fact, 79% of those in the video production](https://www.kapwing.com/resources/future-of-video-and-ai/)

**[field are optimistic about the future of AI in video creation, with 76% believing that AI boosts creativity by](https://www.kapwing.com/resources/future-of-video-and-ai/)**

automating tedious tasks.

**3. SHORT-FORM VIDEO CONTINUES TO DRIVE RESULTS.**

The popularity of short-form videos,

particularly on platforms like TikTok

and Instagram, is undeniable. When

asked how they’d like to learn about a

[product or service, 44% of consumers](https://www.wyzowl.com/video-marketing-statistics/)

said a short video. And videos that

[are under 60 seconds get the most](https://wistia.com/learn/marketing/optimal-video-length#1-videos-up-to-2-minutes-long-get-tons-of-engagement)

engagement. To reach and engage

consumers, brands should create

concise, engaging videos that capture

their message quickly and resonate

with viewers.


-----

**4. USER-GENERATED CONTENT IS A DIFFERENTIATOR IN VIDEO MARKETING.**

User-generated content in video form is becoming a key trend in video marketing. Brands are

encouraging their customers to create and share their own video content related to their products or

experiences. This type of content is perceived as more authentic and trustworthy by consumers, often

[leading to higher engagement rates and improved brand loyalty. In fact, 72% of consumers trust reviews](https://www.go.tintup.com/state-of-ugc-report-2022)

and customer testimonials more than messaging coming directly from the business. Companies that

leverage this trend and incorporate UGC into their marketing strategy can humanize their brand and

build trust with consumers.

**5. TAP INTO ESCAPISM TO CREATE VIDEOS THAT CAPTURE ATTENTION.**

The biggest reason consumers watch videos is “to help me relax and unwind.” They also say they watch

videos for entertainment, to explore their passions and interests, to learn, and to escape from the grind of

[day-to-day life. Here’s a closer look at HubSpot’s findings:](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-video-consumption-is-changing)

Why Consumers Watch Videos

To help me relax and unwind **33%**

To laugh or be entertained **26%**

To explore an interest or passion **13%**

To learn something new **12%**

38.5%

To escape from daily life **7%**


While most companies’ marketing videos will likely need to be somewhat informative, smart brands are

experimenting with adding humor or other forms of entertainment into their video content to capture

consumers’ attention and meet them where they are.
