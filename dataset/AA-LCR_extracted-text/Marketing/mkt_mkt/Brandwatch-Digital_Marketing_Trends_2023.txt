# 2023 Digital  Marketing Trends

###### Brandwatch | The social suite of the future

#### The unskippable intro: What’s to come?

Forget about business as usual. In 2023, marketers will need to
decode the new rules of engagement brought on by groundbreaking
new technologies and fresh platforms.

As marketers, we’re constantly trying to discover new ways to drive
connections and build a following for our brands through the power
of emerging digital technologies. Whether that’s through influencer
partnerships, the development of a metaverse strategy, or tapping
into the NFT craze, the brand-building opportunities are all around us.
But how do we do this in a meaningful way and avoid the pitfalls of
the shiny and untested?

We’ve trawled through our data and pored over the numbers. This
report will give you a clear picture of where the digital marketing
world is going, how leading brands are paving the way, and what
actions your brand can take to leverage them too.

While some of these trends have existed in one form or another for a
while, none of them have held more power than they do today – and
will in 2023. For years, we’ve talked about influencer marketing, the
rise of communities, and augmented reality. But much like the internet
today is vastly different from the clunky, modem-based ’90s version,
these trends are now peaking — and we’re seeing new trends emerge
within those trends.

In other words, these are the most need-to-know trends as we look ahead.

**Let’s get to it.**

#### Trend #1 
## Scrappy content  is thriving

**Trend #1 Scrappy content is thriving**

#### As marketers, we need to do more with less:  get scrappy and creative.

As lockdowns gripped the world, gathering even a small crew to shoot
professional footage became impossible for brands. The trend that
rose from the ashes of high-production-value video content was its
contrarian twin – unpolished, ‘raw’ content. The internet has been in
its grip ever since, and brands are continuing to push the limits.

This is particularly apparent on social media as you’ll see in the early
movers section below. But some brands have taken things a step
further, using very simple, presumably low-cost production methods
in places you’d never expect. For example, the top-mentioned ad for
[the Super Bowl in 2022 belonged to Coinbase. The ad was simply a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIUD_NE1BDo&t=13s)
QR code bouncing around on the screen, yet it generated more than
79,000 mentions online during the game.

Unpolished content isn’t going away – in fact, it feels like we’re still
[yet to reach its peak in popularity. And, with dwindling marketing](https://www.marketingweek.com/media-budgets-fall-covid/)
budgets in the face of economic hardship, this could be a blessing for
the cash-strapped content team.

It’s something that playful B2C brands can revel in, but the trend really
raises questions for organizations who value their polished aesthetic
or that worry about losing their serious reputation.

**Trend #1 Scrappy content is thriving**

#### Early movers

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the platform we’ve seen unpolished content
really thrive on has been TikTok. Here are three accounts from three
very different sectors who are drumming up a lot of attention with
unpolished but highly entertaining content.

**[Pleasing creates a buzz](https://www.tiktok.com/@pleasing)**
Founded by Harry Styles, this nail polish brand was always going to
[be a social media hit. In more recent TikToks, the brand has been](https://www.tiktok.com/@pleasing/video/7161866425647238443?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1&item_id=7161866425647238443)
creating surreal narratives with the collectible glass bottles in which
the nail polish is housed, and viewers are suitably pleased.

**[Mailchimp’s doing it for the B2B brands](https://www.tiktok.com/@mailchimp)**
While they may not be driving enormous numbers with every video,
Mailchimp’s relatively new TikTok account shows that there’s a place
for B2B on the platform too. Marketing hacks and humor are the way
to go, it seems.

**[Duolingo’s mascot takes on TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@duolingo)**
Duo, the iconic owl, has amassed quite the following on TikTok, and
[for a good reason. Their dancing, Halloween costumes, and general](https://www.tiktok.com/@duolingo/video/7166672724297927979?is_from_webapp=v1&item_id=7166672724297927979)
office antics make for a fun watch and a good reminder to do your
language lesson for the day.

**Trend #1 Scrappy content is thriving**

#### Tips for marketers

**1.** **Scrappy content isn’t bad content. This approach can enable**
social media managers to take advantage of trends quickly to
garner immense engagement, all while showcasing a company’s
culture and sense of humor – great for attracting employees.

**2.** **B2B brands and agencies shouldn’t feel left out. While it’s**
tempting to think that this kind of content is just for consumerfacing, “fun” brands, there’s definitely room to explore. Behind-thescenes or day-in-the-life content could be a good place to start, and
thinking about the pain points you’re trying to solve could also help
generate some ideas.

**3.** **Let your imagination run wild. Inspiration can strike anywhere, and**
this unpolished approach to content means marketers can operate
unrestricted. Using the assets and products you already have, like
a mascot or nail polish bottles, there are no limits to how you can
bring them to life. Just make sure to get buy-in from your boss on
what you’re planning before posting anything too outrageous.

#### Trend #2
### The coming of age of influencer marketing

###### Brandwatch’s 2023 Digital Marketing Trends

**Trend #2 The coming of age of influencer marketing**

#### The way influencer marketing works is evolving. Brands need to adapt to stay ahead.

Influencer marketing is nothing new. However, the way brands
leverage influencers is changing. From utilizing smaller influencers
to working on large-scale multi-influencer campaigns, influencer
marketing is a brilliant way for brands to engage with their audiences.

[In 2022, the global influencer market size was $16.4 billion – that’s](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1092819/global-influencer-market-size/)
[over four times bigger than TikTok’s advertising revenue. Brands who](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1305708/tiktok-ad-revenue/)
aren’t jumping on the influencer marketing bandwagon risk getting
left behind.

##### “Influencer marketing continues to grow at  double-digit rates each year because it’s effective. People are tired of interruptive ads and trust recommendations from those they follow, so  expect to see more brands partner with influencers  to promote their products.”

**James Creech, SVP of Strategy at Brandwatch.**

So, how is this market changing in 2023?


-----

**Trend #2 The coming of age of influencer marketing**

#### Content creators vs. large influencers

In 2023, we’re seeing a widening difference between content creators
and influencers – which are no longer mutually exclusive terms. In
the past, all content creators could be deemed influencers – and vice
versa. Now, the definitions have shifted.

As influencers are gaining popularity – sometimes into the millions
of followers – a disparity has developed between those with high
numbers of followers, and those without. Now, while all influencers
are content creators, not all content creators are influencers.

The term ‘influencer’ has developed to describe individuals with large
followings, who are typically more expensive to work with and have a
pre-established platform. Content creators, on the other hand, work
slightly differently. These smaller-scale micro-influencers produce
high-quality, influencer-style content – without the large fee.

Brands can work with content creators who can produce brilliant
social content for your social platforms without requiring them to
have an established social media presence.

As well as the more affordable cost, another benefit of working with
content creators is that they’re relatable. They’re usually not tied to
working with large brands and may not have well-established opinions
and styles, so they tend not to come with preconceptions from your
audience. Their ability to be neutral and easy to relate to means
these content creators could be the perfect fresh face for your brand
on social media. UNiDAYs do this brilliantly to appeal to a student
audience – we’ve added more detail in the Early Movers section below.

**Trend #2 The coming of age of influencer marketing**

#### Virtual influencers

Virtual influencers are an interesting concept – one which marketers
will need to grasp to stay ahead of the curve. A virtual influencer is
exactly what it says on the tin; an artificially generated, fictional social
media character. Created by companies or individuals with an eye for
influencing, these virtual influencers are growing in popularity. People
are curious about virtual influencers, which is why they’re succeeding
so well on social.

While the concept has been around for a while, the hype around
[this modern way of influencing is growing. In fact, in 2022, 35% of](https://www.territory-influence.com/virtual-influencers-and-their-social-media-appeal-to-brands-in-the-meteverse/)
**[American consumers purchased a product or service promoted by](https://www.territory-influence.com/virtual-influencers-and-their-social-media-appeal-to-brands-in-the-meteverse/)**
virtual influencers, with 40% of them being Gen-Z or millennials.

**Trend #2 The coming of age of influencer marketing**

A number of well-known brands have adopted virtual influencers
in 2022, and they’ve done it well. Prada tackled the virtual

While arguably a strange concept, virtual influencers have become
increasingly common in a short amount of time. Interest in this new
[phenomenon is growing, and the market size is expected to grow by](https://www.candidplatform.com/en/news/market-news/marketing/the-rise-of-virtual-influencers-threats-and-opportunities-for-brands.html#:~:text=With%20a%20market%20size%20of,being%20Gen%2DZ%20and%20Millennials.)
**[26% from $4.6 billion by 2025. Perhaps interest in the metaverses](https://www.candidplatform.com/en/news/market-news/marketing/the-rise-of-virtual-influencers-threats-and-opportunities-for-brands.html#:~:text=With%20a%20market%20size%20of,being%20Gen%2DZ%20and%20Millennials.)**
is creating a new slew of interest in the virtual influencer market, with
some virtual influencers creating their own spaces.

**Trend #2 The coming of age of influencer marketing**

#### Early movers

**UNiDAYS’ work with content creators**
Student discount website UNiDAYS launched a TikTok strategy
which has brought in millions of views. They work with hundreds
of content creators to make entertaining videos for their platform,
which speaks directly to the student audience.

**Trend #2 The coming of age of influencer marketing**

**PacSun works with virtual influencers**
PacSun worked with well-established virtual influencer Lil Miquela to
promote their new Soho Store under their #pacpartner initiative. The
brand has seen plenty of success with their #pacpartner hashtag,
which has over 6,000 posts.


-----

**Trend #2 The coming of age of influencer marketing**

#### Tips for marketers

**1.** **Stay on top of influencer trends. The influencer space is maturing.**
In 2023, we can expect a variety of new influencer trends to
surface. Utilizing influencers for marketing purposes is nothing
new, but the ways in which brands do this are likely to change.
Keep an eye on a variety of influencers on socials so you can stay
ahead of the curve.

**2.** **Utilize content creators. The gap between influencers and content**
creators is growing. Marketers should utilize them both in different
ways to maximize reach on social media. Look for content creators
who hold your brand values and work with them consistently.

**3.** **Don’t ignore virtual influencers.** **[Virtual influencers receive higher](https://medium.com/xr-marketing/6-reasons-why-virtual-influencers-will-be-essential-for-social-media-and-metaverse-strategies-404597e84bef)**
engagement rates than real people. Making use of their space
in the metaverse, as well as their social media presence, could
be worth keeping an eye on for brands wanting to expand
their digital reach.

#### Trend #3
### It’s totally in  to be ethical

###### Brandwatch’s 2023 Digital Marketing Trends


-----

**Trend #3 Its totally in to be ethical**

#### Ethical brands are statistically more profitable. It’s time to get involved.

[According to Investopedia, companies that lay the framework for](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040715/how-important-are-business-ethics-running-profitable-business.asp#:~:text=Companies%20that%20lay%20the%20framework,business%20in%20an%20unethical%20manner.)
business ethics in all facets of operations are more likely to become
and remain profitable than their counterparts who don’t value
[ethics. Plus, companies on Ethisphere’s list of World’s Most Ethical](https://ethisphere.com/2021-wme-announcement/)
Companies consistently outperform correlative companies, by
around 7%.

From sustainability to inclusivity, building your business on ethical
foundations is key to improving a brand’s relationships with
customers, employees, and business partners. And this doesn’t stop
[at profits. Employees tend to remain loyal to, and perform more](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040815/why-are-business-ethics-important.asp)
effectively for, a company with a high standard of ethics.

Brands that implement these principles across their digital strategy
will likely reap the rewards in 2023.

#### Sustainability in business

It’s nothing new that the sustainability conversation is bigger than
ever. In fact, over the last three years, the conversation has grown
substantially. In 2022, the conversation peaked at almost 1.5 million
mentions per month in September and October.


-----

**Trend #3 Its totally in to be ethical**

The importance of sustainability is seeping into business practices
[globally. In a 2022 study of 850 companies, 80% stated they planned](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/more-than-60-of-companies-prioritize-esg-in-their-digital-transformations-301514352.html#)
to increase their investments in sustainability.

[Meanwhile, Capgemini reported that 77% of consumer products and](https://www.capgemini.com/gb-en/insights/research-library/how-sustainability-is-fundamentally-changing-consumer-preferences/)
retail organizations found that sustainability leads to increases in
customer loyalty.

With this in mind, brands need to be aware of the shifting
conversation and the high importance of implementing sustainabilitybased business practices. With more and more consumers valuing
sustainability and green initiatives from the brands they buy from,
businesses face losing customers if they don’t prioritize sustainability.


-----

**Trend #3 Its totally in to be ethical**

#### Inclusive marketing

Consumers want to see themselves in the brands they buy from,
and companies need to tweak their marketing efforts to appeal to
diverse demographics.

[In 2022, Nielsen found that 59% of Black viewers are more likely](https://www.nielsen.com/insights/2022/amplifying-black-voices-in-media/)
to buy from brands that feature someone from their identity group
[in advertisements. Add to that, Twitter has found that the LGBTQ+](https://marketing.twitter.com/en_gb/insights/a-point-of-pride-how-well-do-brands-represent-the-lgbtq-plus-community)
community are loyal and influential advocates for brands that
resonate with them, meaning brands should speak up and be
[authentic in their support for the community. Plus, 72% of Gen Z](https://www.cxnetwork.com/voice-of-the-customer/articles/the-stats-that-show-lgbtq-allyship-drives-brand-loyalty-and-sales)
said they would consider brands’ political leanings before making
a purchase.

In 2023, brands will need to be actively inclusive in their marketing
efforts on digital platforms. By doing this, brands can maximize
their reach to potential customers on social media.

**Trend #3 Its totally in to be ethical**

#### Early movers

**Fenty’s inclusivity makes billions**
[In 2022, Rihanna became the youngest self made billionaire woman](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/04/rihanna-is-now-americas-youngest-self-made-billionaire-woman.html)
in the US, and Barbados’s first billionaire. This is largely due to her
business ventures like Fenty Beauty, which was created so that
women can feel included and empowered – with a lineup of shades
for people of all colors.

**Roccamore rewards saving energy on Black Friday**
Shoe retailer Roccamore launched an initiative to encourage
consumers to save energy at home for Black Friday. If a customer
saves 30% energy in a given week, they’ll be rewarded with a 30%
discount code for their next purchase.

**Patagonia’s emphasis on ethics**
[In 2022, Patagonia’s founder went as far as donating the entire](https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/brands-that-became-bigger-than-their-product/)
**[company to a charitable trust which fights climate change – a move](https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/brands-that-became-bigger-than-their-product/)**
which obviously generated a huge buzz. The brand has always lived
and breathed its ethics, and it still commits 1% of its total sales to
environmental groups.


-----

**Trend #3 Its totally in to be ethical**

#### Tips for marketers

**1.** **Show off your brand values across social media. Brands that**
share ethical practices across their digital presence will see
increased benefits. From a wider consumer base to increased
sales, statistically, these brands are more likely to benefit than their
unethical counterparts.

**2.** **Improve inclusive marketing efforts. Try to keep your customers**
in mind when planning digital marketing campaigns. From casting
different genders to expanding your product range to encompass
a larger demographic, inclusive marketing benefits everyone
involved.

**3.** **Don’t be scared about evolving. Don’t be afraid to change your**
marketing efforts to be more inclusive. As long as you do your
research and implement your company values in your marketing,
your audience will respond well.

#### Trend #4
### A cookieless future

###### Brandwatch’s 2023 Digital Marketing Trends


-----

**Trend #4 A cookieless future**

#### Without cookies, it will become harder to track users across the web. It’s time to prepare.

Cookies are the blood of most marketing teams. From gathering data to
tracking user journeys, cookies help marketers find out vital information about
their consumer base. However, changes in Google’s cookie strategy could
impact ad-tracking in 2023, changing the way we use cookies for good.

Google plans to phase out third-party cookies on Chrome browsers in
2023, not long after Apple did away with access to device identifiers
[on iOS. As of October 2022, Chrome has a 65% market share of](https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share)
internet browsers, with Safari in second at 19%. With such a large
percentage of internet users opting for Chrome as their default
browser, marketers are going to be impacted heavily by this change.

Users are demanding greater privacy, which is a main driver for
Google’s decision. So, is it the end of cookies? And how can marketers
implement new ways to gather vital data in a cookieless future?

[Interestingly, 41% of marketers believe their biggest challenge from](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/third-party-cookie-phase-out)
Google’s cookie changes will be the inability to track the right data.
So, if you’re a marketer who relies on robust data for online advertising,
pop-up ads, or a pin-pointed audience-targeting strategy, you’ll need
to consider new ways to find your data.

In 2023, we expect there to be a rebalance of digital ad spending to
include more brand-building and less over-targeting. Digital advertisers
will need to be proactive in their marketing efforts, to create a positive
brand identity for consumers as a whole – to focus less on specific
targeting. Leading with a strong brand identity is key, so consumers
can recognize your image across your digital presence.

**Automated Creative uses social listening to test ads**
[Tech company Automated Creative has created an innovative way to](https://www.brandwatch.com/case-studies/automated-creative-kfc/view/)

and customer surveys. Plus, work on strengthening your SEO
strategy to compensate for the loss in ad traffic.

**3.** **Diversify your marketing tactics. Due to Google’s new policy,**

people will respond to your content without burning the budget on
campaigns that are doomed to fail. Implementing sturdy marketing
tactics outside of digital advertising can help to fill the gap left by
a lack of third-party cookies.

#### Trend #5
### Brands  tackle social  media fatigue

###### Brandwatch’s 2023 Digital Marketing Trends

**Trend #5 Brands tackle social media fatigue**

#### Brands are battling social media fatigue by encouraging healthy relationships with the digital world.

Throughout the pandemic in 2020, social media usage skyrocketed
as individuals looked for ways to fill up their free time and connect
with others. However, this peak in users has seen an interesting shift
[since lockdowns began to ease. According to a report by Global Web](https://www.gwi.com/reports/social)
Index, since 2020, there’s been a 12% increase in individuals saying
they use social media less than they used to.

[Interestingly, Gen Z is the most concerned about time spent on social](https://www.gwi.com/reports/social)
media, compared to other generations. They’re also more likely to
use social media less than they may have previously. In 2023, we’ll
likely see an even bigger increase in users opting to avoid social
media, or who actively monitor their social media usage.

We used Brandwatch Consumer Research to dive deeper into the
conversation online about people deciding to leave social media.
Between January and October 2022, interestingly, 53% of emotioncategorized mentions about wanting to leave social media were
categorized as sad. Anger was the second most prevalent emotion,
at 27% of emotion-categorized mentions.


-----

**Trend #5 Brands tackle social media fatigue**

Many social media users state boredom as the largest factor for not
deleting social platforms. It seems many individuals no longer find as
much value from social media, or are experiencing growing fatigue
from extended use of these platforms.

Brands are beginning to incorporate this social media fatigue in their
digital strategies, offering ways for their audiences to find a break on
their platforms. Here are some brands doing this well.

**Trend #5 Brands tackle social media fatigue**

#### Early movers

**Boohoo partners with The Brain Coach for mental health**
To battle poor body image, fashion retailer Boohoo partnered with

week. This came after the retailer found that 70% of its customers

This is part of a wider campaign to make Boohoo’s customers feel

social media.

**Trend #5 Brands tackle social media fatigue**

**Lush launches The Global Anti-Social Media Policy**
Cosmetics brand Lush quit four of the biggest social platforms
– Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat. Instead, they’re
encouraging their audience to spend time elsewhere, in order to gain
more from their time on social. Instead, the company is growing
its YouTube presence, using Twitter for customer care, working on
valuable email newsletters, and being inspirational on Pinterest.


-----

**Trend #5 Brands tackle social media fatigue**

#### Tips for marketers

**1.** **Focus on keeping the attention of your audience. Brands who**
do this will make the most of their limited time with audiences
on social media. Brands will need to provide true value via their
content, to make a stronger impact on their audience. Equally,
companies might need to switch up their social strategy to meet
their target demographic where they’re spending the most of their
time.

**2.** **Shift your focus to account for mental health within your social**
**strategy. Encouraging consumers to have a healthy relationship**
with their social usage can help create a safe space for when they
are ready to return to the platform. Equally, consumers are likely to
associate your content with a positive message, which reflects well
on your brand.

**3.** **Build strong relationships with your customers. The more your**
audience is used to seeing your content, the more likely they are to
pay attention. Keep your messaging consistent across your social
media channels to reap the benefits.

**Trend #6 Communities are on the rise**

#### People want to belong and connect, creating an opportunity for brands to deepen their relationships with their customers.

Smart brands have a strong presence where their customers
are. For years it was enough to be present on the biggest social
networks, implement your social media presence, and figure out the
algorithms. But there’s a shift happening that we think will become
more visible in 2023.

One reason consumers spend time online is to connect with people
or brands they love. On the big social networks, it’s getting more
and more difficult to cut through the noise. 2022 saw some hype
[with new apps like BeReal or Gas, indicating that people hunger](https://nypost.com/2022/10/03/new-social-media-app-bereal-is-considered-anti-instagram/)
for something new. With the rise of Web3, we’ll also see more
decentralized networks over the next few years.


-----

**Trend #6 Communities are on the rise**

Younger audiences want to have more control over the pages they
[operate. They want more privacy, and the introduction of authentic](https://corporate.freedompay.com/whitepapers/effects-of-monetary-rewards-and-data-privacy-levels-on-generation-zs-willingness-to-share-personal-data/)
apps like BeReal and Gas shows that people long for places where
they can be their true selves. Communities and niche platforms can
deliver this experience and offer brands a chance to get closer to
[their customers. According to research by Hubspot and LoyaltyLion,](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/4855278/Feb_20_consumer%20research/Loyalty-up%20close%20and%20personal.pdf)
47% of consumers say they would become loyal to a brand if they
were part of a community with like-minded people.


-----

**Trend #6 Communities are on the rise**

The desire for closer connections online has contributed to the
rise of community platforms like Reddit and Discord. Discord,
for example, began as a platform for gamers to communicate
in-game. It has since grown into a place where communities thrive.
[In September 2021, Discord reported 150 million global monthly](https://www.statista.com/topics/9816/discord/#editorsPicks)
active users, an increase of 50 percent compared to June 2020.
[Reddit’s also growing among young people. A 2021 survey found](https://www.statista.com/statistics/261766/share-of-us-internet-users-who-use-reddit-by-age-group/)
that 36 percent of internet users aged 18 to 29 years use Reddit.
However, the reach of the social platform strongly declines with age.

Brands might benefit from tapping into this need for community and
getting involved on platforms that value connectivity. For example,
you might create a Discord server for your consumers to chat with
each other or provide value on subreddits where potential customers
might spend their time.

**Lego and the value of crowdsourcing**
We’d be remiss not to mention one of the earliest movers in this
field, which continues to see the value in bringing passionate people

RECUR, Zach Bruch, said these digital collectible experiences offer
fans a community to be part of for years to come. The collections
did face some backlash though, when some die-hard fans argued
that NFTs and their favorite movies do not go together.

##### “Communities are important spaces for brands and have the power to create loyal advocates. But this does not happen overnight. Brands must invest in their communities or risk falling behind competitors who have accurately identified their customers’ and prospects’ need for trusted peer content and social validation.” 
**Ian Ferguson, Brandwatch Community Platform Manager.**

**Trend #6 Communities are on the rise**

#### Tips for marketers

**1.** **Niche content for a dedicated audience. Put in some research**
before you build your audience to find out what your audience
wants. Think about what value you can give them. This could be
sharing knowledge, exclusive information and events, or making
them feel heard in future product developments.

**2.** **Nurture relationships. The core of a community is the relationships**
that members build with each other. While your main goal is to
get people to love your brand, you should focus on something
other than brand promotion but on delivering a close ‘gathering’
experience where people can share and gain information about the
topic they love.

**3.** **Encourage user-generated content (UGC). Once successfully set**
up, your community will have a pool of highly-dedicated consumers.
Motivate them to post their experiences and knowledge in the
community. Hearing product recommendations from other customers
is seen as much more trustworthy than promotions from brands.

**Trend #7 Augmented reality as the preferred way to shop**

#### Consumers expect marketers to seamlessly connect digital experiences with physical stores.

The pandemic gave augmented reality technologies a considerable
push. With big players in the tech industry – like Apple, Google, or
Snapchat getting involved – we’re set to see plenty of innovations in
2023.

[The AR and VR market gained 28 billion dollars in 2021, and is](https://vrheaven.io/top-ar-vr-trends-to-watch-in-2023/)
**[expected to grow to more than 450 billion U.S. dollars by 2030.](https://vrheaven.io/top-ar-vr-trends-to-watch-in-2023/)**
With AR technology, brands can remove digital customer experience
barriers, connect physical stores with online shops, and reach
younger consumers.

Especially in retail, virtual try-on features have become more and
more popular. Consumers can virtually fit cosmetics, clothes, or
[furniture before they buy. According to Brandwatch Consumer](https://www.brandwatch.com/p/consumer-research/)
**[Research, the online consumer conversations around ‘virtual try-ons’](https://www.brandwatch.com/p/consumer-research/)**
continues at a high level. In fact, mentions increased by 8% between
January and November 2022 compared to the same period last year.

‘Experience’ is the most mentioned keyword in online consumer
conversations around ‘virtual try-on.’ New technologies can enhance
the digital shopping experience, and consumers are excited about
it. And it’s not all about shopping: AR technology could revolutionize
[the healthcare industry in the next ten years.](https://venturebeat.com/datadecisionmakers/augmented-reality-superhuman-abilities-and-the-future-of-medicine/)

Let’s look at some brands that are excelling at using AR technology
for their marketing initiatives.

**Trend #7 Augmented reality as the preferred way to shop**

#### Early movers

**The Home Depot boosts conversions with AR**
This home improvement retailer offers consumers the chance to
virtually fit furniture or decorations in their homes, via its mobile app.
AR helps consumers see if specific items fit the size and style of their
rooms before they purchase the product. And it works. The Home
[Depot saw two to three times higher conversions from consumers](https://www.ar.rocks/posts/home-depot-conversions-augmented-reality)
using AR technology compared to those who don’t use it.

**Pull & Bear introduces a collaection with AR game**
Inditex, the fashion giant behind Pull & Bear, launched their first
**[AR-powered game in May 2021. People could play the game via](https://fashionunited.uk/news/retail/inditex-launches-ar-game-for-pull-bear-girls-collection/2021050555319)**
Facebook or Instagram and go on a virtual journey. With gamification,
the brand can reach a younger audience in a playful and fun way.

**Nike reaching younger audiences with Shopping Lenses**
**[332 million Snapchat users are engaging with augmented reality](https://www.adweek.com/media/snapchat-reaches-332m-daily-active-users-at-end-of-q1-2022/)**

with AR technology, allowing them to reach younger audiences.
[Snapchat users can virtually try on Nike shoes via the app and see](https://time.com/6138147/augmented-reality-shopping/)
how they would look on them. This can help to remove purchase
barriers and reduce returns.

**Trend #7 Augmented reality as the preferred way to shop**

#### Tips for marketers

**1.** **Be playful. With all-new technology, there’s room for**
experimentation, trying new things, and inspiring others. Do
research around ways you can complement your consumer needs,
and experiment with ways to implement new tech.

**2.** **Make AR part of your customer experience. Consumers want**
to try products before they buy them. This is one of the biggest
buying barriers with online shopping. With AR technologies, you
can inform purchase decisions and reduce return rates.

**3.** **Connect the digital with the physical. Don’t keep your digital and**
physical stores separate. Rather, they should complement each
other. Create a holistic customer experience by making shopping
in your physical stores more interactive and personalized for your
customers.

**Trend #8 Metaverses set a new level of gamification**

#### With metaverses, companies could reach a younger audience and implement gamification in their marketing strategies.

The idea of metaverses received a lot of hype in 2022, receiving
a slew of both positive responses and worthy criticisms. While
metaverses aren’t a mainstream thing in the slightest just yet, more
and more consumers are warming to the idea that metaverses are on
the rise.

Between 1 January and 15 November 2022, there were over 19.2
million mentions of metaverses in online conversations. According
[to BuzzSumo, over 265k articles were published, generating over 13](https://buzzsumo.com/)
million engagements.


-----

**Trend #8 Metaverses set a new level of gamification**

[2022 was a year of firsts. There was the first metaverse fashion show,](https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-first-ever-metaverse-fashion-week-digital-fashion-is-here-to-stay)
[not to mention the first financial service provider that entered the](https://sandboxgame.medium.com/hsbc-to-become-the-first-global-financial-services-provider-to-enter-the-sandbox-c066e4f48163)
space. But what will 2023 have in hand for brands? Will metaverses
finally become mainstream?

Probably not, but metaverses will be a big topic in the digital
marketing space in 2023. We will see more campaigns and
collaborations, brands creating their own spaces, and companies
looking for ways to measure their success.

[According to research by McKinsey & Co., metaverses could be worth](https://venturebeat.com/games/mckinsey-co-metaverse-could-reach-5-trillion-in-value-by-2030/)

metaverses offer a chance to create new experiences for consumers.

Especially for reaching younger people, metaverses are a valuable
channel for companies. Gen Z, and the succeeding generation alpha,
spend more time on metaverse platforms like Fortnite or Roblox
than other generations. Gamification is one of the most important
marketing tools to connect with them.

**Trend #8 Metaverses set a new level of gamification**

#### Early movers

**Gucci and their virtual garden**
In May 2021, luxury brand Gucci opened a garden in Roblox. People
could visit the garden for a limited time and buy digital clothing for
their avatars. Users visiting the garden end up with an avatar with
a unique pattern depending on their interactions they made in the
rooms. The clothing they earned was influenced by the experience
they had in the garden.

It was a success. One virtual Gucci bag from the event later got resold

over 22k likes and is one of the posts with the highest engagement
in online conversations around metaverses in 2022. The event led to
over 10k mentions on social, from almost 6,500 unique authors.

[and toy brand Lego teamed up to build a family-friendly metaverse.](https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/7/23014616/epic-lego-metaverse-partnership)
While the collaboration is still in the making, the project tackles
an important issue: how to protect children in metaverses without
excluding them from the experience.


-----

**Trend #8 Metaverses set a new level of gamification**

#### Tips for marketers

**1.** **Don’t forget your brand voice. Metaverses may seem a colorful**
playground for some, and it’s easy to get lost in the bubblegum
scenery of Fortnite and Co. But it’s important not to lose your brand
voice and identity and stay alert to the fact that not everything that
happens in the metaverse stays in the metaverse.

**2.** **Be inclusive. Metaverses offer new ways for people to express**
themselves and interact with people globally. As a brand, you
should be as inclusive as possible. Whether you’re making an NFT
makeup filter for digital avatars or curating a whole new space, it’s
important to make sure everyone is welcome to enjoy it.

**3.** **A potential game-changer. The immersiveness of the metaverse**
could be a whole new way for brands to build fantastic customer
experiences. But new and cutting-edge also means more risks are
involved, and there are still many unknowns that marketers should
be wary of.

### Brands continue to experiment with emerging technologies

**Trend #9 Brands continue to experiment with emerging technologies**

#### Brands are evolving in how they use new  tech, recognizing it as an opportunity to make  the headlines and engage with customers  in new ways.

From artificial intelligence and machine learning to NFTs and blockchain
technology, the past few years have seen the emergence of a number of
exciting technologies that offer brands new opportunities to create interesting
marketing activations. In 2023, we expect to see more brands using emerging
technologies and push the boundaries of what they’re capable of, but as
with all experiments there’s an element of risk to be aware of.

Take NFTs for example. The last couple of years have seen a boom in
[interest and promising projections for growth, while brands have shown real](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/fintech/digital-assets/nft/worldwide%23transaction-value&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1669988324944683&usg=AOvVaw0Tn0k_12gktBob02nttuFL)
creativity in this area (see the early movers section). As you can see from
this topic cloud, which shows positive mentions around NFTs online in 2022,
there’s a lot of excitement about the community, artists, and collections.

**Topic cloud showing commonly used words and phrases in positive**

with positive sentiment mentioning NFTs from January 1 - November 14 2022.


-----

**Trend #9 Brands continue to experiment with emerging technologies**

All that said, if we look at the search data around NFTs, it seems
like consumer interest in the topic has already reached its peak and
searches are in decline.

And while there’s plenty of hype on social, this community-focused
conversation is driven by those actively engaging in trading and
collecting NFTs – a group who are naturally going to sing the praises
of the trend.

Experiments help push the industry forward, but marketers should
always exercise caution before jumping into expensive new
activations, especially when budgets are tight.

**Trend #9 Brands continue to experiment with emerging technologies**

#### Early movers

**Reddit and collectible avatars**
Speaking of communities, Reddit (the biggest network of
[communities) launched collectible NFT avatars. Created by](https://nftnow.com/culture/how-reddits-collectible-avatars-blew-up-the-nft-space/)
independent artists and Reddit creators, the unique avatars were
quickly sold, and some avatars landed later on the NFT marketplace
OpenSea in the top 10 list of favorite NFTs.

**Heineken wants us to raise our glasses**
VR glasses, that is. In April 2022, Heineken launched their new virtual
[Heineken Silver: “Our virtual beer is made only from the freshest](https://www.heineken.com/gb/en/agegateway?returnurl=%2fglobal%2fen%2four-products%2fvirtual-silver)
**[pixels: no malt, no hops, no yeast, no water and also, no beer.” While](https://www.heineken.com/gb/en/agegateway?returnurl=%2fglobal%2fen%2four-products%2fvirtual-silver)**
taking the mickey out of the digital world and urging users to “try to
try it” in the metaverse, Heineken’s point is that some things — like
beer — are better enjoyed in the real world.

**Hugo Boss sets engagement records**
**[Hugo Boss used NFTs as part of their fashion week campaign in](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/hugo-boss-gains-largest-social-media-coverage-in-fashion-week-history-with-4-billion-impressions-in-4-days-896410384.html)**
October 2021. Alongside collaborations with influencers, the fashion
company also started a TikTok challenge and offered unique NFT
jackets as prizes. The campaign was hugely successful. Over 1.3
million videos were created by people on TikTok, and the brand
achieved four billion impressions in four days, the largest social
media coverage in fashion week history.


-----

**Trend #9 Brands continue to experiment with emerging technologies**

#### Tips for marketers

**1.** **Stay true to your brand. While it can be tempting to dive head-first**
into new technology, it is — still — essential to be consistent across
all consumer touchpoints. The real winners will be the brands that
manage to join new trends while being faithful to their brands.

**2.** **Check the tide. Experiments can be expensive. Before jumping in,**
check to see how other brands have fared and how general interest
in the technology you’re trying out is trending. Without the pressure
of hosting virtual events or launching NFT collections right off the
bat, brands can still embrace small-scale experimentation and try
new things that align with their brand.

**3.** **Never lose sight of your audience. Before you start experimenting**
with emerging tech, you should find out whether your audience
is open to it. You should also make sure that people not as techsavvy have an easy option to buy and access your content.

#### Trend #10
### Multi-format content

###### Brandwatch’s 2023 Digital Marketing Trends


-----

**Trend #10 Multi format content**

#### Marketers will need to diversify their content offering to shape up to consumer needs.

Consumers want tailor-made experiences. Remarkable content.
Fits-like-a-glove personalization. And they want it yesterday. On top
of that, they also want blog posts, webinars, infographics, podcasts,
videos, quizzes, white papers, case studies, eBooks, articles,
checklists, newsletters... the list goes on.

Sound excessive? We’re afraid that means you’re already
falling behind.

Year after year (and yes, we’ve been guilty of this at Brandwatch, too),
brands try to predict what content formats will take the cake from
short-lived vertical videos to conversational podcasts. But the truth
is that no single format will rule for long.

Since the pandemic killed off the five-day office work week,
**[the demand for content of all kinds has only increased, leaving](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/content-marketing-market-size-to-grow-by-usd-487-24-billion--by-objective-platform-end-user-and-geography---forecast-and-analysis-2022-2026--301562808.html)**
brands with no choice but to offer consumers a broader catalog
of experiences to meet a wider range of lifestyles.

It’s tempting to think that it’s the value of your content that matters,
but the format you use to demonstrate that value will determine to
what degree your audience takes action in 2023.


-----

**Trend #10 Multi format content**

Text is one way to go about it (be it short or long-form, blog posts or
eBooks). Audio will give you emphasis and enthusiasm beyond bold,
italic, and underline. Video offers visuals to enhance your message.
Finally, you’ve got the interactive and immersive virtual reality
experience of metaverses we’ve talked about above.

[With content marketing’s projected increase of $487.24 billion](https://www.technavio.com/report/content-marketing-market-size-industry-analysis)
**[from 2022 to 2026, it is safe to say the demand is growing and](https://www.technavio.com/report/content-marketing-market-size-industry-analysis)**
that several different content formats have gained popularity in
recent years.

Take a look at podcasts, for example:


-----

**Trend #10 Multi format content**

Riding on the consumer popularity of podcasts, we’re also seeing
tech giants getting more serious about podcasts. Recently,
[YouTube made a fairly significant move and launched a dedicated](https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/22/youtube-launches-a-dedicated-podcasts-homepage-for-u-s-users/)
**[podcast homepage.](https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/22/youtube-launches-a-dedicated-podcasts-homepage-for-u-s-users/)**

So, yes, audio content is booming.

But some brands even take it beyond what we can read, see, and hear,
and they capitalize on the senses of taste, touch, and smell. While
the internet cannot yet convey the smell of warm soup, fresh laundry,
[or frosted pine Wunder-Baum, 6/10 expect to be able to digitally](https://www.ericsson.com/en/reports-and-papers/consumerlab/reports/10-hot-consumer-trends-2030)
**[experience natural smells by 2030.](https://www.ericsson.com/en/reports-and-papers/consumerlab/reports/10-hot-consumer-trends-2030)**

The point is: Consumers are more likely to spend their time and
hard-earned money on products that perfectly align with their tastes,
desires, and demands. They want stories and experiences developed
for them, not only containing the information they want but also in the
form they prefer to consume. As a result, brands will have to expand
their content strategies in 2023 and beyond, identifying the content –
and the style of content – their consumers want.

And while we’ve established that the internet still does a lousy job of
conveying smell, certain companies are already utilizing the chemical
language of scent with offline campaigns. In August 2022, Chipotle
turned an online conversation into a real product when they launched
a lemonade-scented candle inspired by fans who ‘accidentally’
fill their water cups with lemonade. This cheeky, limited-edition
soy candle campaign generated a lot of buzz and sold out
almost immediately.


-----

**Trend #10 Multi format content**

#### Tips for marketers

**1.** **Be accessible. As a marketer, you want to repurpose your existing**
content in a wide range of formats and spread it around. Start
writing down your thoughts, uploading your podcasts, sharing your
slides, filming your day-to-day, and live streaming your events.

**2.** **Communicate in local and detailed terms, targeting specific**
**audiences based on what is most relevant to them. This might**
mean creating specific content for a generation, location, gender,
or hobby. Still, now that companies have access to so much data,
users expect them to provide tailored experiences across the entire
customer journey.

**3.** **Personalize your content experiences to connect with your**
**audience. To quote Chipotle’s CMO, Chris Brandt, “When they see**
these lighthearted tributes to social chatter and fan behavior, they
feel even more connected to Chipotle.”


-----

#### A few final words

The digital marketing landscape is constantly changing. From NFTs to
social fatigue, marketers need to be nimble to meet evolving customer
needs. As consumers get used to new tech, or as they move to new
ways of spending their time online, it’s important for brands to meet
their audiences where they are.

It’s impossible to try every single new trend, but it’s definitely possible
to dabble in new ways to reach your audience.

Try implementing one or two of these trends into your digital strategy
to reap the benefits with your consumers.
