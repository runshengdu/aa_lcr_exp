## WelcomeIntroduction

A welcome from
Suzanne Kounkel,
Deloitte US chief
marketing officer


Welcome to 2023 Global Marketing Trends!

This report comes from Deloitte’s CMO Program,

a team committed to connecting chief marketing

officers with the tools and resources needed to

succeed. For this year’s report, insights were

gathered from 1,015 C-suite executives and lead
ers from brands across the world to begin to

understand how they plan to approach 2023.


From these ideas, and through consultation with

subject matter experts across Deloitte, this year’s

report explores how we as marketers are uniquely

positioned to create new levers for growth. During

these volatile times of financial uncertainty, we

should use our power as storytellers to keep the

critical matter of sustainability at the top of our

agendas—especially at a time when it could be

deprioritized—and suffuse creative thought to

stimulate growth throughout our companies.

_2023 Global Marketing Trends aims to act as a_

guide for these issues at a critical point in time.

It also offers meaningful considerations for pro
pelling your brand and organization forward in the

coming year and highlights the technologies we

think are set to make the biggest splash.

We may operate in different industries, we may

talk to different customers, but as CMOs, we face

similar business decisions. I’m fortunate enough

to work at an organization that allows me to col
laborate with leaders and experts from all corners

of the business world. I hope that by sharing their

knowledge with you, it will not only help your

business grow, but help our profession flourish.


Regardless of what challenges lie ahead, this

report could help you take control of your mar
keting strategy. So, get reading and please get in

touch if we can be of help to you. My colleagues

and I are here to support you.

I can’t wait to see what we build together this year,

### Trend 1 Brands answer economic instability with marketing investments


-----

01    02    03    04

What are the top priorities of chief marketing officers in
navigating economic downturns?


Marketing has gone through a renaissance over

the past 10 years, but while much has changed,

there is likely much more change still to come.

Where there was once only a promise of marketing

acting as a driver of accountable growth, today

that promise has been realized. This promise

is partly due to capabilities such as dynamic,

one-to-one personalization, where each customer

has the right message at the right time and place;

or through better ways of running a marketing

organization, where teams and partners can

spend more time focused on strategic delivery

across the business versus executing on tactics.

The introduction of technology and data has

forever changed marketing, giving it a seat in

the boardroom.


The past two years spent in a global pandemic

have only deepened marketing’s impact. There

has been growth, innovation, and agility in the

way marketing has reacted to help navigate and

thrive through dramatic and unprecedented

times. However, we are now transitioning into

a period of economic uncertainty that will test

marketing’s resolve once more. Based on a global

survey of chief marketing officers (CMOs), we

identified three ways CMOs are leading the

charge and driving impact beyond cutting costs.

Investing in marketing during a downturn could

contribute to future growth. A CMO can think

like a chief financial officer but still apply their

own unique mindset.


-----

01    02    03    04

**CMOs’ top priorities to consider**
**during economic instability**

Many brands surveyed have indicated that

navigating the current state of economic

instability and rising inflation is their top concern

for the coming year. But rather than hedging their

bets and cutting costs, brands are answering this

instability with an investment mindset: growing

their organization’s capabilities and capacity

to endure whatever tribulations an economic

downturn may bring.

**Innovative companies**
**are likely to reduce**
**costs, increase customer**
**engagement, and pioneer**
**entirely new offerings for a**
**piece of the budding market.**


**Accelerating the move to new**
**digital technologies or platforms**

Digital platforms and technologies offer a long

list of use cases and benefits for marketing. Well
designed digital platforms can streamline and

simplify the customer experience, incentivizing

customers to engage more deeply on digital

platforms and capturing valuable customer data.

Capitalizing on this data can offer opportunities

to improve customer loyalty, satisfaction, and

lifetime value through better personalization and

decreased friction at every step in the customer

journey.

Our CMO survey respondents shared which

technologies they have their eye on. Some

marketers are prioritizing artificial intelligence

(AI) and analytics to help orchestrate better

experiences and paint a more holistic picture of

the customer. Other frequently cited technologies

and platforms include virtual reality, augmented

reality social platforms (such as through social


In a series of interviews with over 20 CMOs across

the globe, we explored what they are doing to

secure their companies against current and an
ticipated economic instability. Their responses

indicated that their top three priorities are:

1. Accelerating the move to new digital tech
nologies or platforms

2. Expanding into new markets, segments, or

geographies

3. Implementing systems or algorithms to en
hance customer personalization (figure 1)

While we examine each of these investment areas

in depth, our conversations with CMOs reveal

that these top three priorities are often linked.

commerce), and digital currencies. While the use

cases and benefits of these technologies and

platforms vary, we still wanted to understand why

CMOs now see a need to accelerate their adoption.

Stephanie Nägeli, chief marketing and innova
tion officer of SV Group, helps illustrate a crucial

underlying trend: “What we are seeing is that our

guests are much more digitally savvy than they

were before. Everybody knows how a QR code

works these days, so for us it’s really important to

leverage technology and digital in order to create

a much more seamless customer journey.”1

While technologically savvy consumers may ex
pect more from their digital experience, meeting

and exceeding these expectations could help

brands capture an entirely new customer base

on top of building and retaining loyalty within

their existing base. Expanding the customer base

is also the second-most important priority for

01    02    03    04

**Expanding into new markets,**
**segments, or geographies**

As a degree of attrition can be expected during an

economic downturn, tapping into new markets

can dampen this impact and help set the business

up for future success.

While there are many avenues to expanding

the customer base, our interviews with CMOs

revealed that their efforts often directly tied the

digital landscape with market expansion. Gregor

Eicher, head of marketing and sales for Bank

Cler, says his organization is using a strategy of

expansion by refocusing on digital channels:

“We’re a young brand, so we’re still in a growth

phase. We are decreasing physical touchpoints

and moving to digital touchpoints. We want to

increase product awareness and bring in new

customers for our smart banking app. We want to

use this as a key channel for the bank.”²


**Implementing systems or**
**algorithms to enhance customer**
**personalization**

The third-most important priority our respondents

shared is using systems or algorithms, such as

data platforms and machine learning, to enhance

customer personalization. New platforms and

systems that integrate first-party data from

customers with information about geographic,

sociopolitical, and even weather and climate data

can assist CMOs in uncovering new insights into

customer behavior and preferences from larger

sources of data. The evolution in personalization

brings data directly into the hands of marketers

and arms them with a detailed understanding of

the factors that drive consumer behavior, helping

to predict a customer’s likelihood of purchasing

or churning, or their lifetime value.


Bank Cler is not alone; as Nägeli mentioned earlier,

an increasingly digitally savvy world can bring a

new set of opportunities for capturing customer

segments but can also reset expectations as

customers begin to view a seamless digital

experience as table stakes.

Improvements in digital capabilities may also

help enable a new level of precision in marketing

that could open new growth opportunities for

the company. Microsegmentation of customer

cohorts is maturing, and investments provide

new ways to sense and help react to changing

market conditions in more precise and relevant

ways. It’s no longer about reaching as many

customers as possible, but instead reaching the

right ones. These digital capabilities and systems

that can improve customer targeting go hand in

hand with enhancing CMOs’ final top priority.


-----

01    02    03    04

It’s important to note that these types of detailed

segments are fluid and evolving, so dynamic seg
mentation becomes critical. However, through AI

and machine learning, combined with experimen
tation and a test-and-learn culture, brands can

dynamically tune their marketing and messaging

based on ever-changing consumer behavior.

Implementing these systems successfully can

require coordination and end-to-end integration

within the organization. Antonia Lepore, CMO of

AXA, stresses this point: “If you want to do really

good personalized and automated marketing,

you need help from your IT colleagues, you need

data colleagues, and the systems have to talk

together.”3


While AI and other algorithms can help improve

personalization at scale, these capabilities

should also be paired with other human-centered

methodologies, such as behavioral science or

ethnography, to build a complete picture of

the customer and uncover the _why behind the_

data. Cristian Cabello, CMO of main Latam car

dealer Derco, stressed the importance of a joint

methodology: “Data will lead us to the points of

contact with advertising [that] are increasingly

personalized and more relevant—but here I also

have to be emphatic that artificial intelligence

isn’t enough for us to put together models, if we

don’t combine or accompany it with a deep human

knowledge through ad hoc research of our clients.

The key to generating this personalization is with

a correct understanding of the client, mixing data

with research on the client’s experience.”4


Our survey results indicate that the majority of

CMO respondents currently do not have such

capabilities in place—but this is set to rapidly

change. Thirty-eight percent of CMOs are looking

to deploy the capabilities that enable this type of

personalization within the coming year, with an
other 12% within two years5—signaling a major

shift for the field of marketing.

**“If you want to do really good**
**personalized and automated**
**marketing, you need help from**
**your IT colleagues, you need data**
**colleagues, and the systems have**
**to talk together."**

**—Antonia Lepore**
**chief marketing officer, AXA**


-----

01    02    03    04


**How can other CMOs navigate**
**these same priorities?**

-  Partner well—or integrate completely.

Having leading tech alone will only get you so

far. To accelerate your brand’s move to new

digital technologies and platforms, Lepore

stressed the need for CMOs to work closely

with key partners across the organization.

Identify and confer with stakeholders on how

to optimize these technologies for everyone’s

benefit, and to help ensure a seamless back
end integration. Some of the most progressive

companies are working to break down these

walls entirely, establishing data science and

technology as core functions of marketing.


Test often. With an increasingly digitally savvy

society, Nägeli observes that expanding into

new markets can correspond directly with

expanding operations onto digital platforms.

However, a difficult customer experience

on a hastily rolled-out website or app can

discourage both current and potential cus
tomers from engaging with your brand. CMOs

should consider carefully testing and honing

platforms to accommodate customer needs

and help facilitate a seamless customer ex
perience before leaning into this strategy.

Combine data science with a human touch.

Data science provides an important but in
complete piece of the puzzle. As Cabello

notes, brands should blend data with hu
man-centered methodologies to create a

more complete picture of the customer, pre
vent mistakes an algorithm can’t always un
derstand, and cultivate connections with the

customer

### Trend 2 Chief marketing officers drive growth through internal sustainability efforts


-----

01 02    03    04

As sustainability and equity continue to be important for
consumers, two industries are leading the way in their efforts—
setting an example for other industries and even consumers.


**Sustainability as an imperative**
**for growth**

Sustainability is an overarching ethos that requires

developing a business model that is sustainable

for the earth, the economy, and society. These

matters are increasingly vital to meet market,

regulatory, and governmental demands and are

also a central concern for consumers. Many

brands are focusing on sustainability, defined

broadly, as a key part of building a brand with

staying power.


Sustainability is one subject that has captured

the attention of marketers for several years. Once

seen as a hot-button issue, sustainability has

grown into a matter that is not only the right thing

to do as a responsible corporate citizen but can

also be good for business. Brands that focus on

sustainable business practices can become more

relevant and profitable as well as grow: all the te
nets that chief marketing officers (CMOs) strive

for. These practices also become a lever that

brands can use to stay ahead of cultural trends.


How are brands responding to the growing

imperative of investing in sustainability issues?

A Deloitte survey of 1,015 CMOs indicates that

brands are concentrating their efforts on shoring

up their own internal sustainability practices as

opposed to focusing externally on influencing

customer behavior.1 For example, brands working

on internal sustainability might be focused on

reducing paper waste or energy usage, or creating

more sustainable or transparent supply chains,

among other actions.

Brands reported that their top three priorities for

sustainability efforts this year include (figure 1):

1. Improving sustainability of internal marketing

practices

2. Promoting more sustainable product and

service offerings

3. Establishing long-term sustainability commit
ments

Internal sustainability efforts can not only help

establish the authenticity of a brand’s marketing

initiatives—building trust with consumers—

but they can also help the brand build a more

secure, sustainable future for itself in the face

of heightened global uncertainties. Notably,

relatively few brands are moving the responsibility

to consumers, with only 25% saying they are

trying to nudge new consumer actions, indicating

that brands are taking ownership of sustainability

actions and trying to lead by example

While some brands may feel the impulse to pull

back on sustainability in times of economic uncer
tainty, these responses show that a strong focus

on sustainability should continue as consumers

remain deeply concerned about global and eco
nomic events and expect proactive action toward

protecting the wellness of the planet. Marketers

should remain vigilant on meeting and exceeding

expectations on matters of sustainability to re
main relevant in the marketplace.

Michael Schuld, chief commercial and market
ing officer at MediaMarktSaturn Retail Group,

explains that sustainability is a requisite for

leadership and growth: “Being a market leader in

Europe means for us, we have to have answers to

[sustainability]. This is not a trend; this is a must

because we have only one earth. Of course, we

also see it from an economic aspect: Our cus
tomers, especially younger ones, want to see

answers on that. Otherwise, you will not be their

way. [We] are thinking about circle economy. We

think about second life programs. We even think

more about products as a service.”2

As marketers consider their sustainability efforts,

our data suggests they should consider a “be, say,

do” approach in which they begin by developing

internal practices that are aligned with their pur
pose. This should be done _before brands focus_

on communicating their values externally, and

before they begin developing external practices

aligned with their values.

**“We have to have answers to**

**[sustainability]. This is not a**
**trend; this is a must because we**
**have only one earth."**

**—Michael Schuld,**
**chief commercial and marketing officer,**
**MediaMarktSaturn Retail Group**


**Driving sustainable growth:**
**Health care and energy are**
**leading the way**

When we looked at marketing priorities by indus
try, two industries stand out as placing a high

emphasis on sustainability and equity: Energy,

resources, and industrials (ER&I) has “building

more sustainable capabilities” as its top priority,

at a rate nearly double the cross-industry average.

Meanwhile, life sciences and health care (LS&HC)

has “building more inclusive capabilities” as one

of its top three priorities (figure 2).

The reason behind this emphasis could be that

global events of the past few years have forced

companies in the ER&I and LS&HC industries to

adapt quickly, in some cases even before they

were ready. To help ensure their organizations are

prepared for unexpected challenges, CMOs can

look for lessons from these industries that are al
ready focused on social issues.


**_ER&I invests in the future by focusing on_**
**_sustainability_**

When asked how they plan to improve customer
centricity in marketing efforts, ER&I respondents

cited meeting customer values. Since customer

values increasingly include sustainability and

equity, it is no surprise that these organizations

were most likely to report an emphasis on

sustainability efforts this year.

Kevin Moens, corporate director for sales and

marketing at Eastman, explains Eastman’s deep

commitment to sustainability: “In the coming

years, we are committed to a strong investment

strategy in sustainability, regardless of the mac
roeconomic environment. We are investing in

molecular recycling technologies that enable us

to unzip plastic waste and bring the polymers

back to their basic molecular components, allow
ing for infinite recyclability and bringing about

a truly circular economy. These technologies

produce virgin like plastics with a substantially

lower carbon footprint compared to the legacy

fossil feedstock-based processes, an important

element as we look to tackle both the plastic

waste and climate crises.”3 He notes that this

emphasis is being driven from all sides: govern
mental regulations, potential, and current talent,

and consumers themselves.

Bree Sandlin, vice president of lubricants market
ing for Shell, likewise explains that Shell’s efforts

“in adapting sustainable methods and products

[are] absolutely critical to Shell’s long-term suc
cess,” based on its deep connection to customers

and their needs. She says, “Shell has publicly set

an ambition of being a net-zero emissions energy

company by 2050 or sooner.” To accomplish this

ambitious goal, Shell has engaged in several sus
tainability initiatives, including building a portfo
lio of sustainable products and services to help

reduce the carbon footprint of its customers,

using more recycled materials in products and

packaging and decarbonizing its supply chain


operations. These ambitious internal plans also

aim to help Shell introduce customers to new

decarbonization opportunities. By focusing their

efforts internally now, brands can set an exam
ple for consumers in making sustainable choices

down the line.4

**_LS&HC builds value through equity_**

Equity issues have been important in LS&HC for

a long time, says Kathryne Reeves, CMO at Illumi
na, but recent world events have made them even

more pressing: “[W]e didn’t really need to read

a study to tell us to care about equity. Our cus
tomers tell us. I think COVID exposed the deep

inequities, particularly in western economies, be
tween the haves and the have-nots. We praised

the caregivers, the supply chain workers. We said

all the right words, but at the end of the day, many

of those people have substandard health care,

and we saw that in the mortality rates.”5


During the height of the pandemic, Illumina

created technology to track COVID-19 variants

globally, providing data for global leaders to use

to protect the health of vulnerable members of

society.

Bringing sustainability and equity together to im
prove the health of consumers and the planet has

also been a priority at Johnson & Johnson (J&J)

Consumer Health. Katie Decker, president of

Global Essential Health, Healthy Lives and Global

Customer Development at Johnson & Johnson

Consumer Health, explains that her team’s work

in this area is about engaging social responsibility

as a vital part of driving growth: “It’s working with

all the functions across the company to make

them understand that sustainability not only is an

imperative; it drives value. It drives growth. It’s an

expectation of our consumers and our custom
ers, and we can turn this into a value-generating

proposition for our brands while doing something

good for people’s health and the planet ”6


-----

01 02    03    04

**Sustainability for uncertain times**

Organizations that wish to thrive in the future

should continue to invest in the kinds of

products and marketing efforts that help ensure

a healthy, equitable world before circumstances

become urgent. We recommend that marketers

consider the following in their sustainability efforts

this year:

-  Don’t pull back. Although cutting down on

sustainability investments might feel tempt
ing during a time of economic uncertainty,

marketers should continue to invest, retain
ing a sense of long-term perspective about the

socioeconomic demands around sustainabili
ty on the horizon.


Look inward. Marketers can infuse sus
tainability throughout the entire life cycle of

the product or service—leading to improved

efficiencies, increased brand value through

customer alignment, and ongoing impetus

for growth.

Unify your organization. Marketing can and

should play a leading role on sustainability

issues within their organizations. Marketers

excel at telling stories and rallying people

behind their efforts. These skills should be

leveraged to allow them to lead the charge

on internal sustainability efforts.

### Trend 3 Creativityasaforceforgrowth


-----

01    02 03    04

Data and analytics may have gained prominence over creativity in
addressing modern marketing challenges, but the latter can still be
valuable—if done the right way.


Some may say that being creative is a fundamental

part of the human experience. It can be a means

of discovering ourselves, overcoming adversity,

and finding a way to inspire hope in challenging

times. Creativity is a process our brains could go

through to see a problem in a new light and find

a solution that works outside the bounds of the

“standard approach.” But in the business world,

which prioritizes optimization and guaranteed

results, thinking outside the box can risk our

careers, success, and relationships. Often, we

stick to the road well travelled with playbooks,

mimic our competitors, or make incremental

improvements to tired methods.


Chief marketing officers (CMOs) may be the

executives best positioned in the organization

to emphasize the importance of creativity in a

business. Whether during a time of transition,

as a business seeks to develop new markets by

finding unmet needs, or in an economic downturn

when customers, employees, and partners need

the inspiration to find resilience, CMOs can be

the force behind never letting the business settle

for the status quo.


-----

01    02 03    04

**Creativity in the spotlight**

Growth has been a primary responsibility for

CMOs. However, as generating growth becomes

more complex due to rapid societal, techno
logical, and **[economic changes, many brands](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/marketing-and-sales-operations/global-marketing-trends/2023/marketing-investments-during-economic-instability.html)**

have responded by doubling down on data and

analytics. While these analytical tools are now

often viewed as essential for any contemporary

marketer, there are indications of an imbalance.

Organizations may now lack the creativity needed

to meet the challenges of the modern business

world, as manifested in fewer creative leaders in

the C-suite and lower emphasis on creative skills

among CMOs and marketing talent.1

Creativity can go well beyond brand communi
cations and advertisements, using innovative

thinking to shape how systems are designed,

challenges are converted into opportunities, em
ployees collaborate, and organizations engage

with customers and other stakeholders.


Our Deloitte survey of 1,015 executives indicates

that creativity in this form does, in fact, contribute

to growth. High-growth brand respondents

(defined as those with annual revenue growth of

10% or more) are more likely than their negative
growth peers to have the mindset and processes

to allow creativity to flourish. Not only are higher
growth brands more likely to view creative ideas

as essential to long-term success, they are

also more likely to create an environment that

supports creative thinking by encouraging risk
taking and cross-functional collaboration (figure

1). The percentages shown may seem low for

high-growth brands, but it should be noted that

only the “strongly agree” responses are displayed

(that is, the brands that are fully committed to

these ideals); when including “agree” responses,

the proportion of high-growth companies who

responded approaches 90% for each attribute.


And at a time when we are seeing a shift from

creative skills to analytical skills across the mar
keting function, high-growth brands surveyed are

more frequently doing the opposite by consider
ing creative thinking as one of the most important

attributes for talent.[2]

**Taking the creative lead**

One of the features of this new approach is

that creativity is no longer limited to select

individuals or teams. In fact, joint research from

Deloitte Digital and LIONS reveals that one of

the key elements of successful creative business

transformation is finding “hidden” creatives from

surprising sources—not just every employee, but

also external partners, suppliers, and customers, all

of whom can act as wellsprings of creative ideas.3

While creative ideas can come from any of these

sources, the CMO is sometimes best positioned

to be the champion of identifying and activating

these ideas across the enterprise. As the

executive closest to the consumer, translating

these ideas into practical business applications

may be key to driving transformative success.

Perhaps it is no surprise, then, that we see high
growth companies more than their negative
growth peers leaning on marketing for creativity

(figure 2)

CMOs might consider the following strategies to

encourage creativity in their organizations:

-  Redefine what creativity can offer. Creativi
ty is no longer confined to single advertise
ments or campaigns. This shifts the priority

for CMOs from delivering one-off projects to

consistently delivering products, services,

and experiences that allow a brand to stand

out. Cristian Cabello, CMO of main Latam

car dealer Derco, says, “I believe the greatest

challenge for a brand is to be able to deliver

differential services or experiences that go

beyond what is innovative or traditional in

the industry. They (those experiences) must

be relevant and agree with cultural, econom
ic, or political fluctuations of the countries

where we are present. Being consistent over

Bring the rest of the organization along for

the ride. While CMOs and the marketing

function can play a lead role in a brand trans
formation, all functions should be aligned on

business aspirations. For Cargill Protein &

Salt CMO Chuck Gitkin, this means ensuring

marketing and innovation teams are working

closely with functions like sales, operations,

and supply chain, especially on innovation.

According to Gitkin, this collaboration allows

Cargill to “reliably commercialize and supply

innovative products and solutions to its cus
tomers,” ultimately scaling the impact of the

organization’s offerings.5



-  Inspire the organization to think differently.

Encouraging risk-taking and providing room

for failure can encourage creative thought.

But encouraging your organization toward

more creative risk-taking may require effec
tive leadership. Take the example of Tasha

Boone, assistant director of communications

at the US Census Bureau, who considers

creativity essential to delivering on the bu
reau’s vision. For Boone, this means connect
ing functions and ideas into a single, unified

strategy while giving individual employees

the freedom to express themselves within

this strategy.6

It is this type of combination of individual creative

thought with cross-functional collaboration that

can lead to the type of transformative change

that drives growth.

**Beyond the organization**

We are living in an era of cocreation. Creative collab
oration does not need to reside only within the four

walls of the organization. External creative partners

can care just as deeply about a brand and may

come across as more authentic to consumers than

the brand itself. Some of these potential partners,

namely creators and influencers, have large social

followings and are actively looking for brands to

work with. The brands that are willing to share their

voice with select others are the ones that could po
tentially generate a stronger brand community.

Thus, it may not be a surprise that CMOs across all

sectors are increasingly exploring partnerships with

creators if they haven’t already done so. In our sur
vey, we found use of creator partnerships is expect
ed to approximately double in the next year, with

particularly notable increases in sectors that don’t

normally consider such partnerships: life sciences

and health care, and energy, resources, and indus
trials (figure 3)

01    02 03    04

While paying a creator to feature a brand in a

post is an obvious way to engage, it is not a

comprehensive creative strategy. Many brands

are finding that creators can be a natural

extension of the strategic development team.

When asked to rate the ease of conducting

several aspects of the brand/creator partnership,

nearly four out of five (78%) respondents indicate

it is easy or very easy to collaborate with creators

on creative strategy— the highest percentage of

any aspect.[7]


**The brands that are willing to**
**share their voice with select**
**others are the ones that**
**could potentially generate a**
**stronger brand community.**


Research from Deloitte’s CMO Program shows

that creators are also looking for mutually benefi
cial collaborations that help them grow alongside

the brands they work with.8 However, more than

half of surveyed creators (58%) report difficulties

securing partnerships with brands. Considering

the difficulties from the creator perspective, and

the fact that our executive survey showed that

fewer than one-third of brands (32%) are current
ly partnering with creators, there seems to be a dis
connect between the two sides of the partnership.


-----

01    02 03    04

Here are a few ways brands might better include

creators as strategic partners in creativity and

growth plans:

-  Allow for creative freedom. Almost by defi
nition, creators are considered accomplished

at generating information in a way that

engages a core audience. Giving creators the

freedom to express their abilities with min
imal interference can not only lead to more

appealing content but also helps maintain

the authentic voice that is vitally important

to creators and consumers. In the words of

Bree Sandlin, vice president of lubricants

marketing at Shell: “It’s a little scary as a

brand manager to know that you’re releas
ing that control. But it’s telling our brand

story in a way that we could never do with

a level of authenticity and credibility that

consumers need.”[9]


Build a partnership based on relevance.

Just as businesses are likely seeking creators

who are on the same social platforms as

the company’s target audience and who

portray an image that’s compatible with the

brand, creators, as the sole representatives

of their own brands, are likely looking for

company partners that are relevant to the

creator’s audience. In our survey of 400

creators, nearly seven in 10 (69%) indicated

that the top priority when deciding whether

to partner with a business was “relevance

of brand to my audience”—a higher priority

than even monetary value of a partnership.10

A strong partnership may include plans for

how content can be reinforced in a way that

leads to growth for both brand and creator.


Align on expectations. Creators surveyed

indicated clear expectations are important to

forming an ideal partnership with companies.

When contract terms plainly define how

creators are evaluated, amplified, and paid,

brands do not need to overthink how they

define a successful partnership. Among

brands that partner with creators, the top

two ways of measuring the success of those

partnerships among those surveyed are

“increased engagement on brand channels”

(58% of executives) and “revenue growth”

(57% of executives).11


-----

01    02 03    04

Like every aspect of modern creativity, creator

partnerships are likely to be effective when

integrated into the larger creative strategy

rather than as a solitary campaign. Connecting

formerly disparate stakeholders, functions,

and ideas into a concerted effort to infuse

creative thought across the organization (and

beyond) may seem like a daunting task. Yet,

with a combination of customer knowledge and

business acumen, CMOs are well positioned to

lead this transformation and potentially uncover

new sources of growth.

### Trend 4 Rising technologies for marketers to watch


-----

01    02    03 04

Which new technologies most interest marketing leaders this
year—and which are likely to sustain their interest over the
long term?


**Growing interest in the metaverse**

The metaverse is a confluence of technologies

that allow new forms of experience and

engagement across industries through 3D

activity and the use of simulations based on

artificial intelligence. Interest in the metaverse

is growing rapidly, with many brands expecting

to use the metaverse to link the physical and

virtual worlds over the next one to two years.

While more business-to-consumer industries

have been getting a jump on developing a

metaverse strategy, our survey of 1,015 marketing

executives shows that even industries such as

energy, resources, and industrials (ER&I) and life

sciences and health care (LS&HC) are gravitating

toward the metaverse indicating that it is likely a


Striking the right balance between hype and

investment is one part art and one part science for

chief marketing officers (CMOs). It’s impossible

to ignore trends that everyone is talking about,

but unwise to overinvest in unproven technology.

Still, marketers should always be prepared for

emerging technologies that can suddenly create

significant competitive advantage.


The CMO has the potential to determine how

these trends become relevant to their customers.

They can consider, “How can this transform my

business or sector?” This year, our data suggests

Web3 technologies are of growing interest for

marketers, as they offer significant promise to

brands.

compelling issue across sectors (figure 1).1 At this

early stage, brands may be unsure how quickly to

rush to market, so they should assess and define

clear objectives for how their organization will

create experiences in the metaverse. In particular,

brands that wish to be leaders in the virtual space

should consider laying the groundwork for joining

the sphere of unlimited reality.

The top reason brands gave for not already

engaging in the metaverse is that they face

difficulty with developing or implementing the

technology (45% of respondents), issues that

can be caused by limitations in skill sets, talent,

or budget. LS&HC respondents reported even

higher rates of concern (55%) that technology

implementation is a serious barrier.

The data suggests, however, that implementation

barriers are not enough to dampen interest in

the metaverse. Only 10% of respondents said

the metaverse is “not relevant for my industry ”

ER&I sector respondents are the most likely to

believe it’s not relevant to their industry, with 24%

of respondents seeing it as irrelevant. Still, these

numbers suggest that broad adoption of these

new technologies is likely on the horizon.

Marketing executives that we interviewed also

noted that a path toward metaverse adoption is

not yet clear cut. There remain questions about

which metaverse platform to join based on where

customers are most likely to end up. Some brands

reported tentatively exploring existing spaces,

while others reported considering developing

their own. For example, Claire Tellenbach,

marketing manager at H. Moser and Cie. (which

produces luxury watches), says, “For now, we

are developing our own metaverse space, which

is the Moser Lounge to welcome customers

and press. We are exploring different ideas for

launches and press conferences. Postpandemic,

instead of doing huge video calls, maybe we can

host them in the metaverse ”2


**“I deeply believe that the**
**metaverse and all the**
**immersive experiences have**
**that tremendous potential in**
**e-commerce as well, making**
**experiences more immersive**
**for customers before they**
**buy, to try them out.”**

**—Ömer Barbaros Yis,**
**chief executive officer, LC Waikiki**
**E-Commerce Business**


Other brands recognize the value of the

metaverse but are taking a slower approach to

accommodate other competing priorities. Ömer

Barbaros Yis, CEO of LC Waikiki E-Commerce

Business, a European fashion retailer, says, “I

deeply believe that the metaverse and all the

immersive experiences—let’s say metaverse or

virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality, and

all that stuff— have that tremendous potential

in e-commerce as well, making experiences

more immersive for customers before they buy,

to try them out.” However, he also notes, “[The

metaverse] is not my [top] priority, [because]

when people have struggled with prices, with

economics, when they have even struggled to

pay for energy, they care more about affordability

[of the metaverse].”3 Instead, he plans to keep

working on a longer-term road map for adoption

of up-and-coming technologies in years to come.


-----

01    02    03 04

Brands across industries should start to consider

the role the metaverse might play in their market
ing strategy in the medium to long term. In the

coming year, based on our fieldwork with CMOs,

we recommend:

-  Look before you leap. Define your objectives

for creating metaverse experiences and keep

an eye on early adopters who will pave the

way for broader adoption in 2024 and beyond.

Make sure to consider potential challenges

including cybersecurity, trust, brand

reputation, and digital rights management.


Weigh brand priorities in developing your

adoption strategies. Our data shows that

companies are still prioritizing investment

in technology platforms and capabilities to

support personalization and achieve

customer-centricity as a top priority, but

brands that fail to create a strategy for

joining the metaverse may lose the oppor
tunity to become a leader in the space.

Start laying the groundwork for a metaverse

strategy. The metaverse offers CMOs across

industries new opportunities to expand

engagement and experience and to grow

new revenue channels. Marketers that fail to

set a strategy early may find themselves

playing catch-up for years to come.

**Blockchain technology makes**
**gains in regulatory environments**

While blockchain’s use in marketing is still nascent,

pressure to address privacy issues may be fueling

early adoption. Of the CMOs who say addressing

the regulatory environment is their top priority,

35% have already implemented blockchain

technology in their advertising strategy,

compared with 21% of all other respondents

(figure 2). This is because, particularly in regulatory

environments, blockchain offers new possibil
ities for strengthening consumer privacy and

allowing consumers to control their own data.

For example, blockchain offers innovative possi
bilities for the health care sector, which can use

the technology to store, share, and utilize data to

communicate with patients without sharing data

with a third party.

Still, 41% of all CMOs plan to support their

advertising strategy with blockchain in the next 12

months, and blockchain and other technologies

were the fifth-most important technology cited

by CMOs. These data points indicate a larger shift

toward the nascent technology in the coming

year. Tellenbach says that Moser is implementing

the use of blockchain because it offers the

promise of solving specific needs within the

watch market: tracking and authenticating

products over their lifespan and ensuring service

follow-ups even if they are sold or traded on the

secondhand market.4


Different industries will likely need to adopt

different, more localized approaches to these

technologies that carefully prioritize the needs

of their customers with the existing resources

the brands have. Our results show that brands

working in regulatory environments should

probably consider a strategy for blockchain in

the coming year for the data privacy reasons

mentioned above. Other industries, on the other

hand, can keep a close eye on digital currency

leaders to start laying the groundwork for broader

blockchain adoption in the coming years. Less

regulated industries will likewise have the

opportunity to build consumer trust, as well as

to provide a more customized, direct consumer

experience.
