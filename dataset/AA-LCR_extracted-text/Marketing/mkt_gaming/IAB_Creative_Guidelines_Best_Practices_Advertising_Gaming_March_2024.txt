 ADVERTISING IN GAMING

## MARCH 2024


-----

### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This IAB Creative Guidelines and Best Practices in Advertising in Gaming document establishes

standards and recommendations to balance effective in-game advertising with preserving player

experience across mobile, PC, and web-based games.

Key guidelines and best practices covered include:

-  Audio Ads: The optimal length is 15 seconds, including clear disclosure and call-to-action,

following placement and frequency caps.

-  Interactive Overlays: Flexible length up to 60 seconds, pair with chat CTAs, and avoid stream

obstruction.

-  Intrinsic/Native Ads: Display and short video formats should be under 6 seconds long and offer

seamless creative integration, minimal elements, and simple messaging.

-  Rich Media/Playable Ads: These ads should provide players with the option to exit the ad

experience within the first 30 seconds, prioritize player experience through UX safeguards, and

track engagement over impressions.

-  Ethical Considerations: Always respect user privacy, ensure appropriate content, maintain

sponsorship transparency, and avoid stereotypes.

-  Compliance: Abide by regulations including FTC, COPPA, and gaming industry standards.

-  Additional Formats: Console platforms, VR/AR, and accessibility merit different guidelines and

best practices.

These guidelines and best practices aim to standardize in-game ads through industry collaboration

while respecting player experience. They provide essential guidance for advertisers, agencies, game

publishers, and platforms to craft creatives that effectively engage gaming audiences.

### 1. ABOUT THIS REPORT

**1.1. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS**

These guidelines were developed by the IAB Creative Guidelines and Best Practices in Advertising

in Gaming Task Force, which operates under the umbrella of the IAB Games Committee and IAB

Games Board within the IAB Experience Center. The creation of this document has been made

possible through a collaboration between the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) and the Interactive

Advertising Bureau Technical Laboratory (IAB Tech Lab).

**1.2. OBJECTIVE OF THE IAB CREATIVE GUIDELINES AND BEST PRACTICES IN**

**ADVERTISING IN GAMING TASK FORCE**

The primary objective of the task force is to ensure consistency in ad displays, ad exits, and audio

in in-game advertising. The task force has developed a quality assurance protocol across gaming

devices to standardize ads and enhance the player experience.

The rapid growth of in-game advertising has led to inconsistent and intrusive ad implementations

that detract from player experience. Without clear creative guidelines, in-game ads risk damaging

player immersion, frustrating audiences, and reflecting poorly on advertising brands. To uphold high

standards across in-game ad formats, displays, audio, and exits, industry leaders must collaborate

to establish best practices that balance effective advertising with enjoyable gameplay. By convening

gaming and advertising experts, we can develop quality assurance protocols and creative principles

that bring consistency to in-game ads and enhance player experience. Thoughtful guidelines shaped

by cross-industry consensus make it possible to realize the full potential of in-game advertising while

keeping player experience paramount.

**1.5. SCOPE AND APPLICABILITY OF GUIDELINES**
This document defines guidelines and best practices for in-game advertising creative
development and execution for mobile and PC platforms. The in-game ad formats covered
include:

-  Audio ads

-  Interactive overlays

-  Intrinsic/native in-game ads

-  Rich media and playable ads

Out of the scope of this document:

-  Console platforms - PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, etc. Console gaming involves

specialized creative considerations that warrant separate guidelines.

-  Adjacent ad units - Interstitial, banner, and video ads served around or within games should

refer to existing IAB standards.

-  Hardcoded ads - Branded assets integrated directly into game environments are not covered

by these guidelines.

-  Viewability - An important metric but establishing the criteria for viewability is beyond the

current scope of this document.

-  Advergames - Custom-branded games require tailored guidance.

These guidelines are for advertisers, creative agencies, game publishers, and other entities
creating and executing in-game advertising. The best practices outlined here aim to balance
effective advertising with preserving gamers’ immersion and control. By outlining standards for
core interactive ad formats in mobile and PC gaming, these guidelines provide a framework for
developing creative that engages audiences while respecting the gaming experience.


-----

**1.6. GLOSSARY**

As in-game advertising grows more diverse and expansive, it brings a proliferation of industry
vernacular covering new formats, metrics, regulations, and more. The following glossary defines
common terminology and acronyms referenced throughout this document.

This glossary aims to establish a shared language and ensure cohesion in how core concepts
for in-game ads are discussed and understood. It covers topics spanning ad formats, guidelines,
metrics, regulations, gaming platforms, and considerations like accessibility. Use this reference to
gain familiarity with key phrases and shorthand when navigating in-game advertising.

This glossary intends to reduce ambiguity and complexity for the varied players collaborating
to advance the gaming advertising ecosystem. With continued evolution in the space, we invite
industry partners to propose additional terms for inclusion in future iterations. The glossary
represents an important step toward crystallizing in-game advertising as a professional,
structured marketplace founded on common conventions and transparency.

-  Accessibility - Making ad experiences inclusive for gamers with disabilities.

-  Ad Frequency - The number of times a user is exposed to an ad within a given time.

### 2. CONSIDERATIONS FROM EXISTING GUIDANCE


**2.1. IAB ESPORTS AND GAMING FRAMEWORK**

[The IAB Gaming and Esports Advertising Framework is a comprehensive set of guidelines and](https://www.iab.com/insights/gaming-and-esports-advertising-framework/)
best practices formulated by IAB to standardize and enhance advertising strategies within the
rapidly growing sectors of gaming and esports. This framework defines optimal ad formats, es­
tablishes measurement standards, and outlines strategies to engage the gaming audience effec­
tively. It is a resource for advertisers, agencies, publishers, and other stakeholders in the gaming
and esports advertising ecosystem for transparent, effective, and respectful advertising practices.

This new document aligns seamlessly with the principles in the IAB framework. While the IAB
provides a broader perspective on gaming and esports advertising, the creative guidelines
explore the nuances of creative development, ensuring that in-game ads resonate with players
while respecting the gaming environment. These guidelines ensure that the advertising content is
not only effective in reaching its audience but also ethically crafted and presented in a way that
preserves and enhances the gaming experience.

The IAB Gaming and Esports Advertising Framework has undergone refinements with the incor­
poration of the new creative guidelines. Notable additions have been made in categories such
as equipment, graphic style, and genres, enriching the framework’s depth and applicability. To
better synchronize with the broader advertising industry and the IAB Tech Lab Creative Stan­
dards MIME Types Framework, you’ll see updated categorical nomenclature. “Ad Context” is
now “Placement Type” and “Ad Asset Type” is now referred to as “Media Asset Type.” These ad­
justments ensure the framework remains both current and in alignment with industry standards,
offering clarity and consistency for professionals navigating the world of gaming advertising. A
detailed exploration of the updated IAB Gaming and Esports Advertising Framework 2.0 is in
the appendix of this document.

**2.2. IAB TECH LAB NEW AD PORTFOLIO**

[The IAB New Ad Portfolio: Advertising Creative Guidelines provides comprehensive recom­](https://www.iab.com/guidelines/iab-new-ad-portfolio/)
mendations for advertising experiences across diverse digital environments including websites,
mobile apps, social media, messaging, and new experiences like virtual reality. It emphasizes
lightweight ads and flexible ad sizing for optimal consumer experience and page performance.


-----

Specific guidance from the IAB New Ad Portfolio that is particularly relevant includes:

-  Interstitials - The IAB New Ad Portfolio defines interstitials as ads displayed before, in be­

tween, or after primary content. It provides specifications such as requiring a clear close
button and avoiding forced countdowns. These recommendations should inform interstitial ad
implementations within games.

-  Adjacent Video - For adjacent video ads, meaning videos displayed alongside primary

content, the IAB New Ad Portfolio covers aspects like length, user controls, viewability, and
more. These standards help shape adjacent video ads in games so they are not disruptive.

-  Flexible Ad Sizing - The flexible ad specifications provide size ranges across standard units

like banners, rectangles, and vertical units that dynamically fit different screen sizes. This
principle enables better integration of adjacent ads in games.

By referencing specifications already established in the IAB New Ad Portfolio, this document
builds on that existing framework. Standards help maintain consistency and shape non-disruptive
adjacent ad experiences in games, whether display, video, or other formats.

**2.3. IAB INTRINSIC IN-GAME ADVERTISING MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES**

[The IAB Intrinsic In-Game (IIG) Measurement Guidelines provide the foundation for consistently](https://www.iab.com/insights/iab-releases-intrinsic-in-game-iig-measurement-guidelines/)
measuring and reporting on the delivery of in-game ads. As the creative guidelines aim to estab­
lish best practices for creative content and placement of in-game ads, the measurement guide­
lines ensure those ads are correctly counted and analyzed.

The IAB Intrinsic In-Game (IIG) Measurement Guidelines detail requirements for counting valid
ad impressions and viewable impressions for both display and video ad formats. This includes
guidance such as only counting impressions after ads are loaded and begin to render, and
measuring viewability based on time and pixel thresholds.

For intrinsic in-game display ads, the measurement guidelines specify tracking impression counts
after ads are loaded and attached to the game environment. For intrinsic in-game video ads,
count impressions after the first frame of video creative is decoded and attached to the game
environment.

Compliance with these and other measurement guidelines outlined provides the underlying
delivery data to effectively judge creative performance and optimize based on the best practices
recommended in this document. By establishing a consistent measurement framework, the impact
of different creative choices for in-game ads can be compared apples-to-apples when making


-----

future improvements.

In summary, the IAB Intrinsic In-Game (IIG) Measurement Guidelines form the foundation that
enables the creative guidelines for in-game ads to be implemented and optimized. Following
the standardized approaches for valuing and reporting ad impressions and viewability leads to
informed creative decisions and ultimately better player experiences.

**2.4. NEW IAB TECH LAB CREATIVE STANDARDS MIME TYPES FRAMEWORK**

The IAB Tech Lab Creative Standards MIME Types Framework is a cornerstone initiative of the
IAB Tech Lab. This framework outlines a standardized set of MIME types specifically curated for
creative assets in the advertising industry. MIME types, or “Multipurpose Internet Mail Exten­
sions,” function as identifiers for file content types, ensuring that diverse systems uniformly inter­
pret and display these assets.

The benefit of the Creative Standards MIME Types Framework becomes especially clear when
used with the creative guidelines for in-game advertising. These guidelines, while focusing on
the nuances of presenting ads within the gaming environment, need a foundational structure to
ensure the consistency and accuracy of creative assets. The MIME Types Framework provides
a universally accepted catalog of file types that guarantee compatibility and uniform rendering
across platforms and devices.

The dynamic nature of the advertising world calls for a harmonized approach, particularly when
branching into specialized areas like gaming. By aligning in-game advertising with the MIME
Types Framework, we ensure that advertising in games is an integral part of the broader adver­
tising ecosystem. This alignment not only elevates the quality and consistency of in-game ads but
also bolsters the credibility and professionalism of the gaming advertising sector, making it on
par with other established advertising avenues.

For more on the IAB Tech Lab Creative Standards MIME Types Framework see the appendix.

### 3. CREATIVE PRINCIPLES

Effective in-game advertising blends engaging assets and respect for the gaming experience.
Regardless of the ad format, the principles that guide the development and integration of these
creatives are:

**3.1. INTEGRATION WITH GAMEPLAY**

Ensuring in-game advertisements work within the game’s environment is essential:

-  Seamless Weaving and Native Feel: Whether intrinsic or interstitial, ads should naturally

blend into the game environments and avoid being disruptive or disjointed.

-  Resonate With Theme and Branding Elements: All ads, from billboards to banners, should

resonate with the game’s theme and aesthetics. For instance, billboards might display content
for a cityscape game setting, and adjacent ads like banners should echo the game’s motifs.

-  Avoid Disruptive Ads: Avoid pop-ups and takeovers that interrupt gameplay. Instead, look for

natural integrations that complement the game’s world.

**3.2. IMMERSIVENESS AND INTERACTIVITY**

Interactive elements play a crucial role in heightening player engagement:

-  Amplify Player Engagement and Responsive Ads: Design elements should respond to player

actions, like gestures or motions, promoting a deeper connection with the brand.

-  Engage on Player’s Terms and Player Autonomy: Players should be able to engage with inter­

active elements on their terms, dictating their own ad experience.

-  Leverage Game Design Elements: For example, video ads using game design principles are

more effective than generic video content.

**3.3. AD RELEVANCE AND CONTEXT**

Maintaining relevance and context is key for a cohesive gaming experience:

-  Relevance and Genre Setting: Ads should be tailored and consider the specific game genre,

tone, and overall setting.


-----

-  Visual Consistency and Color Matching: Ad visuals, including color palettes, should match

the game’s aesthetics. For instance, brighter colors are typical for cartoon-styled games and
muted tones for more realistic ones.

-  Localized Ads: Tuning ads, especially interstitial and offerwall ads, to player demographics

and preferences improves their relevance and impact.

**3.4. RESPECT GAMERS’ EXPERIENCE**

A gamer’s experience should be your highest priority. Some guidelines to ensure a seamless
integration of advertisements within this experience:

-  **Non-Intrusive Close Button: The ‘close’ button on ads should be clearly visible and**

positioned consistently. Its location should be intuitive, so users don’t have to search for it,
and it should function reliably, preventing gamers from having to tap multiple times.

-  **Avoid Multiple Closures: Users should be able to dismiss an ad with a single click. Re­**

quiring multiple closures may feel deceptive and severely degrade the user experience.

-  **Buffer Zone Around Close Button: Prevent accidental clicks that lead the user to ad**

content unintentionally by adding a non-reactive buffer zone around the close button. This
ensures gamers trying to close the ad don’t inadvertently interact with it.

-  **Option to Exit the Game: Instead of making assumptions about the player’s intent,**

provide a clear option to exit the game or return to the main menu. This respects the player’s
autonomy and decision-making.

By implementing these guidelines, ads can complement rather than hinder gameplay. Obstructive
or non-user-friendly interfaces not only break immersion but also tarnish a brand’s image in
the eyes of the player. It’s essential to provide genuine value with clear and intuitive control
mechanisms, ensuring players always have a choice in their interactive journey.

**3.5. AVOID OVER-COMMUNICATION**

While in-game advertising is a lucrative revenue stream for developers, overloading games with
ads alienates players and diminishes the value of individual ad placements.

By adhering to these principles spanning in-game, interstitial, adjacent, rewarded, and offerwall
ads, brands can captivate players without compromising the sanctity of their gaming escapades.

### 4. CREATIVE GUIDELINES AND BEST PRACTICES


**4.1. AUDIO ADS FOR GAMING**

Audio ads in gaming provide engaging and immersive opportunities for brand messaging.
However, you want to respect the consumer’s gameplay experience and limit disruption.

-  4.1.1. Ad Format and Size

Audio ad assets are no more than 30 seconds long (15 seconds is ideal).

-  4.1.2. Disclosure
The audio should include an audible disclosure stating, “This is an ad” at the start or
midpoint of the asset. The disclosure should be distinguishable from the main audio message,
either by slightly increased volume or with a distinct voice. This helps ensure the ad is
identifiable and ADA-compliant.

-  4.1.3. Call to Action

The main audio ad message should voice a clear call to action that directs the user to
click on a companion banner or logo icon asset to access the advertiser destination.
The companion clickable asset should display a simple brand image or logo on a solid
contrasting background with an identifiable “Close Ad” or “X” control option.

-  4.1.4. Audio Quality

Follow standard audio production quality guidelines to provide an optimal listening
experience. Using quality source files enhances the ad’s ability to capture attention while
remaining non-disruptive. Dynamic range compression helps maintain consistent volume
levels. Include subtle sonic branding like audio logos, but avoid loud volume spikes. Test the
final audio mix across common gaming device speakers and headphones to ensure excellent
fidelity regardless of the playback method. With high production values and consideration
for the listening environment, audio ads can connect with gaming audiences.

-  4.1.5. Placement and Frequency

Audio ads are best used as reward-based opportunities, skippable interstitials, or userinitiated triggers. Cap the frequency at one to three audio ads per 20 minutes of gameplay.
Pacing guidance is one audio ad every three to four game levels but defers to publisher
specifications.

-  4.1.6. Measurement and Additional Guidance

[Ad delivery should be measured using SDK solutions compliant with Open Measurement](https://iabtechlab.com/standards/open-measurement-sdk/)


-----

[Software Development Kit (OM SDK) verification standards to confirm device volume on](https://iabtechlab.com/standards/open-measurement-sdk/)
100% of impressions. In addition to these core guidelines, audio ads must also comply
[with IAB Tech Lab’s LEAN initial load and subload specifications. Most importantly, give the](https://iabtechlab.com/standards/ad-blocking/lean/)
consumer control options such as muting audio or skipping the ad to avoid disrupting their
gameplay immersion.

**4.2. INTERACTIVE OVERLAY ADVERTISEMENTS FOR GAMING**

Interactive overlay ads provide engaging and non-disruptive brand messaging opportunities in
the gaming environment. They should enhance the viewer experience without detracting from
stream content.

-  4.2.1. Ad Formats and Sizes

Overlays can vary from 15 to 60 seconds, with a maximum duration of 60 seconds. Shorter
ads have better viewer engagement.

-  4.2.2. Disclosure

Comply with any additional disclosure requirements from platforms or providers.

-  4.2.3. Call to Action

The overlay itself should not include clickable CTAs. Pair the overlay with a clickable chat
CTA like a link or button for optimal results. Messaging should reference the chat CTA. Limit
chat CTA text to 120 characters maximum, incorporating emojis to maximize visibility.

-  4.2.4. Visual Presentation

Use intro and outro animations to display and remove overlays. Rounded corners and motion
graphics help overlays feel native to gaming streams. Keep text concise and graphics sized
appropriately for heavy mobile viewership. Incorporate gaming imagery and mechanics to
better resonate with the audience.

-  4.2.5. Ad Placement and Frequency

Overlay content should avoid covering crucial stream elements like webcams. Streamers
need controls to reposition and move overlays. Fixed placement versions can interact with
screen edges. Some overlays leverage the full stream canvas space. Individual stream fre­
quency caps of one to three overlays per hour are recommended, with no more than six per
hour. Enforce caps per stream channel rather than per viewer. Limit concurrent overlays to
one active at a time with 15- to 60-minute spacing between.

-  4.2.6. Measurement and Additional Guidance

Rely on platform APIs for delivery metrics. Track chat CTA clicks via UTM parameters or


-----

click verification. Comply with IAB Tech Lab LEAN initial load specifications which prioritize

viewer experience and avoid disrupting or obstructing stream content.

**4.3. INTRINSIC/NATIVE ADS FOR GAMING**

Intrinsic or native ads are integrated into the game environment to provide engaging yet nondisruptive marketing opportunities. The ads should enhance the realism and immersion of the
gaming experience while effectively promoting products, services, or brands to players.

**4.3.1. INTRINSIC/NATIVE DISPLAY ADVERTISEMENTS**

-  4.3.1.1. Ad Formats and Sizes

The length of the display ad unit is not relevant as these ads are not clickable.

-  4.3.1.2. Disclosure

Comply with any platform or region-specific disclosure requirements related to display ads.

-  4.3.1.3. Call to Action

The recommended CTA messaging for intrinsic or native display ads includes concise
phrases like ‘Join xxx,’ ‘Visit xxx,’ or ‘Search xxx.’ This text should be formatted to be bold
and clearly readable, using as few words as possible to convey the message. Avoid web
addresses and QR codes. The CTA should provide clear instructions so you can measure ad
effectiveness.

-  4.3.1.4. Visual Appeal

Design intrinsic/native ads for the gaming environment rather than repurposing designs
from other media. To maintain a clean and uncluttered design, it is recommended that ads
incorporate minimal elements (ideally, no more than three visual elements). Avoid busy
images and textures and choose simple, bright colors. The ad should not overload the viewer
with too much information. Keep a consistent visual look and feel throughout the creative.
Any text headlines should be limited to seven words or less. Finally, any creative not suitable
for out-of-home (OOH) advertising is also not suitable for in-game ads.

-  4.3.1.5. Ad Placement and Frequency

For placement consideration, only use creative assets sized to fit the designated ad space
within the game. Don’t warp creative unless it enhances realism. The ideal placement
depends on the game genre. Follow relevant in-game creative aspect ratio specifications.
An explanation of the new IAB Intrinsic In-Game Advertising Creative Aspect Ratio
Guidelines appears at the end of this document in the appendix.


-----

Cap ad frequency based on campaign goals. For example, brand awareness campaigns
need a lower frequency cap than brand memorability campaigns. You want a minimum
of two ad placements visible on screen at one time, but no more than four or five to avoid
blocking critical gameplay.

-  4.3.1.6. Measurement and Additional Guidance

Follow IAB Intrinsic In-Game (IIG) Measurement Guidelines for counting impressions.

**4.3.2. INTRINSIC/NATIVE VIDEO ADVERTISEMENTS**

Video advertising is a seamlessly integrated and contextually relevant ad that appears within the
gameplay or narrative of a video game. This type of ad enhances the immersive experience for
players while effectively promoting products, services, or brands.

-  4.3.2.1. Ad Formats and Sizes
For in-game video ads, the optimal ad length is six seconds. Given the fast-paced nature of
most games, messaging should be concise and creative assets short.

-  4.3.2.2. Disclosure

Comply with any platform or region-specific disclosure requirements related to video ads.

-  4.3.2.3. Call to Action

Video ads are not clickable so the CTA should be short and concise such as ‘Join xxx,’ ‘Visit
xxx,’ or ‘Search xxx.’ The format should be bold and readable, and as short as possible
(ideally three to five words). Websites and QR codes are not ideal for video ads. Include only
one core message or CTA. Messages should be clear so you can measure ad effectiveness.
Since video ads are muted, any call to action must be text-based. Critical branding, logos,
and the CTA should appear in the first few frames.

-  4.3.2.4. Visual Appeal

Design video creative for the gaming environment rather than using repurposed assets from
other media. Limit text headlines to seven words and avoid visual clutter, with no more than
three visual elements. The logo should be clearly visible and not too small. Leverage the first
three seconds for the greatest impact by leading with the logo and call to action. Use only
essential, minimal animation and avoid distracting transitions at the start and end.

4.3.2.5. Ad Placement and Frequency
For placement, only use creative assets sized for the 16:9 or 4:3 ratio ad spaces designated.


-----

Consider the target audience’s gameplay habits and tailor creative accordingly. Follow
relevant in-game creative aspect ratio specifications. Find an explanation of the new Intrinsic
In-Game Advertising Creative Aspect Ratio Specification at the end of this document in the
appendix.

For placement and number of ads, consider a minimum of two ads concurrently, but no more
than four or five to avoid interfering with gameplay. Avoid “ad stuffing” which slows down
game performance.

Regarding frequency caps, three to five impressions per user per day is considered best
practice to avoid ad fatigue, and this principle also applies to in-game video ads. The
optimal frequency depends on campaign goals and advertiser preferences, though takeover
and sponsorship deals may not adhere to frequency caps.

4.3.2.6. Measurement and Additional Guidance
Follow IAB In-Game Measurement Guidelines for counting impressions.

**4.4. RICH MEDIA ADVERTISEMENTS FOR GAMING**

Rich media and playable ads enable highly engaging and immersive brand experiences in
gaming environments. However, the consumer’s gameplay and control should take priority.

-  4.4.1. Ad Formats and Sizes

Playable ad experiences should include an option to exit the playable ad after 30 seconds,
excluding additional content such as end cards.

-  4.4.2. Disclosure

There must be a clear delineation between the advertising content and the game itself.
Include opt-in and privacy disclosures as applicable, such as camera and microphone
access prompts. Messaging should be concise; limit text overlays to under 20 characters and
headlines to under 25 characters.

-  4.4.3. Call to Action

Messages should be concise and limited to the following character counts:

-  Text overlays: Less than 20 characters

-  Headlines: Less than 25 characters

-  Sub-copy: Less than 100 characters

-  Call-to-action text: Less than 20 characters


-----

-  4.4.4. Visual Presentation

Creative visuals should be accessible across different devices and screen sizes. Provide clear
instructional indications for interactive elements and features. Strive for seamless, contextually
relevant integration into the game environment rather than disruptive overlay banners.

-  4.4.5. Interaction Design

Institute user experience (UX) safeguards like proximity buffers around close buttons to
prevent accidental clicks. Follow click actions with a two-second pause before subsequent
displays. Maintain a reasonable distance between user controls and CTAs to avoid proximity
conflicts.

4.4.6. Ad Placement and Frequency
Playable ads should occupy a significant portion of the viewport, ideally full screen with
framing elements as needed. Hard-coded ads can follow the existing placement and
frequency conventions of publisher specifications.

-  4.4.7. Measurement and Additional Guidance

Base engagement on completed interactions rather than impressions. Consider both
quantitative engagement metrics and qualitative measures of experience impact and value.
Exclude entrance and exit actions from engagement scoring.

In addition to these core principles, rich media ads must comply with initial load specifications
per the IAB Tech Lab LEAN guidance. Most importantly, gamers should be able to opt into or out
of ad experiences.

### 5. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR ADVERTISING IN GAMING

Beyond creative execution, ethical practices ensure advertising contributes positively to the
gaming ecosystem.

-  5.1. User Privacy and Data Protection

Ad platforms must inform players how personal data is collected and used for ad targeting
and measurement, per General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer
Privacy Act (CCPA) regulations. Opt-in consent mechanisms give players control over their
[data and how it’s used. Refer to the IAB Global Privacy Platform (GPP) for further guidance](https://iabtechlab.com/gpp/)
on compliance with data privacy regulations.

-  5.2. Age-Appropriate Advertising

Ads served in games with underage players require additional diligence. Using data signals


-----

like login accounts to restrict adult-themed ads protects younger players. Refer to FTC and
COPPA guidelines for rules and marketing practices appropriate for child audiences.

-  5.3. Avoiding Stereotypes and Offensive Content

Creative concepts should consider racial, gender, cultural, and social stereotypes. Brand
safety technology can detect and filter offensive creative content inappropriate for the
gaming audience.

-  5.4. Transparent Sponsorship and Partnerships

If a game includes sponsored content or partnerships, it should be clear to the players.
This promotes an environment of trust and ensures players are not misled by the origins or
motivations behind certain content.

-  5.5. Sensitivity to Current Events

Advertisers should be aware of global or local events that might make certain content
inappropriate or offensive, even if unintentional. Timeliness and context are crucial in
ensuring ads are well received.

### 6. LEGAL AND REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

-  6.1. Compliance With FTC Guidelines

In the domain of in-game advertising, it’s imperative to follow the Federal Trade
Commission’s (FTC) tenets on truthful advertising. The FTC emphasizes that advertisements
should champion truthfulness, deter deceptive or unfair practices, and ground their claims on
confirmable data.

1. Validate claims, notably those connected to health, safety, or performance.

2. Guarantee that disclosures stand out as clear and evident to viewers.

3. Accurately represent comparative claims, showcasing genuine differentiation from
competitors.

4. Ensure testimonials authentically depict the real-life experiences of actual users.

By committing to these guidelines, advertisers also nurture a bond of trust within the
gamer community. Not following FTC guidelines will lead to stiff fines and harsh legal
consequences.

-  6.2. Compliance With COPPA Regulations

In developing advertising creative for games, it is critical to consider regulations related to


-----

marketing to children, especially the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) in the
United States. COPPA restricts the collection and use of personal information from children
under 13 without verifiable parental consent. This affects creative guidelines such as data
use, ad content, and measurement. When games have child audiences or users, brands
must follow a zero-data approach with no behavioral tracking or targeting. Messaging and
visuals should be age-appropriate. Companies worldwide need to research and comply with
COPPA and similar privacy laws in their region. While the full legal implications are outside
the scope of this document, a baseline understanding of regulations about children’s data will
help guide creative strategies and execution. By keeping child development principles and
regulatory compliance in mind, advertisers can craft gaming creative that engages young
audiences while respecting their privacy.

6.3. Compliance With Video Game Industry Regulations

Navigating the landscape of in-game advertising demands keen attention to the established
norms and regulations of the video game industry. It’s essential to:

1. Become familiar with industry standards and practices that govern in-game promotions
and advertisements.

2. Ensure that in-game advertisements are non-intrusive and maintain the integrity and
immersive quality of the gaming experience.

3. Align ad content with the game’s narrative, tone, and target demographic.

4. Be transparent about any partnerships or endorsements to maintain player trust and
avoid potential conflicts of interest.

5. Monitor and respect any platform-specific guidelines across consoles, PCs, and mobile
platforms.

6. Recognize the global nature of the gaming audience and consider cultural sensitivities
when crafting advertisements.

Straying from industry-set regulations and best practices could result in reputational damage or
potential sanctions. This guide does not cover all nuances of the video game industry’s rules, but
by aligning with basic tenets, advertisers can create meaningful, enjoyable, and respectful ingame advertising experiences.

-  6.4. Intellectual Property Rights

In the intricate landscape of in-game advertising, intellectual property (IP) rights are
fundamental. Several guiding principles related to IP rights include:

1. Value Originality: Using protected materials without proper permissions is a legal


-----

minefield.

2. Respect Licenses and Permissions: If you’re using copyrighted material, trademarks, or
patented practices, you’ll need the proper licenses and permissions.

3. Make Clear Distinctions: Strive for clarity in your creative works to prevent potential
overlap or confusion with existing intellectual property.

4. Safeguard Your Creations: If your advertising content is original, explore legal
protection. This not only secures your assets, it gives them credibility.

5. Be Transparent About Collaborations: Acknowledge collaborations or third-party
content integrations for transparency and credibility.

6. Understand Regional Variances: Intellectual property regulations vary by region; be
aware of these distinctions, especially for global campaigns.

7. Make Regular IP Assessments: Evaluate your advertising materials for potential IP
considerations, ensuring all content is legal.

For more in-depth advice on regulations concerning IP compliance, get specialized advice from
intellectual property experts.

### 7. THE FUTURE OF ADVERTISING IN GAMES


This document covers intrinsic in-game ads within mobile, PC, and web-based games. However,
there are new platforms and emerging formats that warrant future examination to cover creative
best practices more comprehensively across gaming.

This document represents an essential initial framework. Subsequent revisions will expand
coverage across console gaming, virtual reality, augmented reality, and accessibility as the
gaming advertising ecosystem advances. Establishing consistent creative and measurement
standards future-proofs the guidelines as in-game advertising evolves.

**7.1. CONSOLE PLATFORMS (PLAYSTATION, XBOX, NINTENDO SWITCH)**

Major console platforms like PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch represent a significant
portion of the gaming landscape. As console gaming grows and evolves, future guidelines
will consider console-specific creative, including factors like large-screen displays, controllerbased interactions, and integrated system-level ad experiences. However, it is important to
note that ads created for consoles should align closely with the creative specifications outlined
in this document, as the core principles for effective and non-disruptive advertising in games
apply regardless of platform. While screen size, input methods, and ad integration may differ
across platforms, consistency in areas like ad frequency, positioning, style, and interactivity


-----

will allow for a cohesive user experience and facilitate adoption of in-game ads by players.
Thus, advertisers should refer to these best practices as the foundation for console ad creativity,
with supplemental platform-specific guidelines serving to optimize rather than drastically alter
implementations. Working within this framework will set clear expectations among buyers and
enable the seamless integration of advertising across console and other gaming platforms over
time.

**7.2. VIRTUAL REALITY (VR) AND AUGMENTED REALITY (AR)**

Immersive virtual reality and augmented reality gaming experiences represent emerging
opportunities for ad platforms. Unique creative assets and approaches are required to advertise
in VR/AR games effectively.

The IAB New Ad Portfolio provides initial guidance on VR ad formats like interactive branded
3D objects, 360-degree video ads, and full virtual branded rooms. It also covers AR ad
components like visual overlays triggered by scannable real-world images.

Future creative guidelines for gaming must establish best practices tailored to VR/AR games.
This includes specifications for assets like 3D models and environments, spatial audio, motionactivated and gesture-based interactivity, and dynamic virtual product integration.

With VR/AR gaming still maturing, these specialized guidelines will be crucial as brands
increasingly leverage new formats like playable VR mini-games and object scanning to unlock
AR experiences. By optimizing for immersive environments, ads can enhance rather than detract
from VR/AR gameplay experiences.

The IAB New Ad Portfolio provides a preliminary framework for VR/AR gaming ads. Future
creative guidelines will expand on this groundwork with gaming-specific guidance on producing
engaging VR/AR ad content.

**7.3. ACCESSIBILITY**

Gaming is increasingly inclusive, but barriers remain for gamers with disabilities. Future
guidelines should outline creative standards and technical specifications to maximize
accessibility in gaming ads. This ensures equitable ad experiences for all players regardless of
physical or cognitive abilities.


-----

### 8. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The IAB Creative Guidelines and Best Practices in Advertising in Gaming provides a framework
for balancing effective in-game advertising with preserving gamers’ immersion through standards
for ad formats, lengths, disclosures, calls to action, placement, frequency, visual appeal, and
ethical compliance across mobile, PC, and web gaming. By promoting greater transparency and
collaboration across stakeholders, these guidelines enable advertisers, agencies, platforms, and
publishers to create cohesive, non-disruptive ad experiences that engage gaming audiences. This
document serves as an essential reference for the industry to realize the full potential of in-game
ads and shape a sustainable, profitable marketplace founded on respect for players.

-  The optimal audio ad length is 15 seconds with clear disclosures and CTAs that follow

placement and frequency caps.

-  Interactive overlays can be 15 to 60 seconds. Pair these with chat CTAs and introduce and

remove them carefully to avoid disrupting gameplay. Use minimal visual elements and simple
messaging.

-  Rich media ads should be 30 seconds, max. Prioritize player experience through UX

safeguards. Track engagement over impressions.

-  Ensure ethical compliance regarding user privacy, age-appropriate content, sponsorships,

and avoiding stereotypes.

-  Abide by relevant regulations including FTC, COPPA, and gaming industry standards.

-  Future guidelines will cover console platforms, VR/AR ads, and accessibility considerations.

-  Collaborate across advertisers, agencies, platforms and publishers to balance effective ads

with preserving player enjoyment.

-  Provide essential guidance for creating in-game ads that engage audiences while respecting

gaming experiences on mobile, PC, and web.

**8.1. ENCOURAGEMENT FOR RESPONSIBLE GAMING ADVERTISING**

Games present a unique platform for advertisers to champion responsible gaming habits.
Advertisements should avoid endorsing excessive gameplay durations or leveraging
aggressive monetization methods. Brands can set a precedent by advocating for well-balanced
entertainment suitable for players spanning all ages and risk groups.


-----

**8.2. CALL TO ACTION FOR INDUSTRY COLLABORATION**

These guidelines provide an essential foundation, but the key to their lasting relevance lies in
sustained collaboration. Industry frontrunners in gaming, advertising, creative agencies, and
platform services must unite in their commitment to refining best practices. Establishing feedback
channels that interconnect creative ideation, player assessments, and publisher actions will drive
iterative enhancements. Central to this collaboration is the inclusion of varied player insights,
ensuring that the guidelines meet the evolving needs of the gaming community. As with the
inception of these guidelines, the ongoing journey demands proactive, transparent collaboration
to elevate the gaming ecosystem.

12.1. IAB Intrinsic In-Game Advertising Creative Aspect Ratio Guidelines

These guidelines present suggested practices for creative ratios in the gaming industry. This
initiative aims to offer flexibility and align with evolving in-game advertising trends, connecting
web and mobile formats with the gaming context.

Guidelines Overview:

-  Alignment with high-performing display ratios. The new guidelines align with the most
common display ratios used in the industry.

-  Alignment with video ratios. The new guidelines also align with the most common video
ratios used in the industry. This will ensure that creatives are displayed correctly in video
ads.

-  Custom ratios are not considered a “standard buy.” This will ensure that all creatives
are displayed consistently across the industry and that it is easier for media planners to
compare the performance of different campaigns. However custom ratios can still be
used.

-  Higher quality assets. Creative and trafficking changes will be made to allow for the
upload of higher-quality assets. This will improve the visual quality of creatives, making
them more likely to be seen by users.

The implementation of these guidelines is expected to influence the gaming industry. Enhanced
visual quality of in-game ads may contribute to better user experiences, potentially leading to
higher engagement and retention. Standardized buying processes for in-game ads could stream­
line campaign creation and analysis for media planners. These guideline specifications are
anticipated to improve gaming content quality and user experiences for both advertisers and
players, without asserting a definitive outcome.

Flexibility in Ad Size and Aspect Ratio:

This section addresses the challenge of detaching fixed sizes from aspect ratios in in-game
advertising:

Guidelines Overview:

-  Recommendation vs. Requirement: While gaming resolutions can be recommended, they
should not be seen as strict requirements. This approach allows for more creativity and
adaptability in ad design.


-----

-  Minimum Width as a Key Determinant: The minimum width of an ad should ultimately
guide its size on the advertising side. This flexibility ensures that ads can be effectively
integrated into various game environments without being constrained by rigid aspect ratio
standards.

-  Balancing Creativity and Consistency: By focusing on minimum width rather than fixed
aspect ratios, advertisers can tailor their creative assets to different gaming contexts while
maintaining a consistent quality and user experience.

This approach aims to provide a more dynamic and responsive framework for in-game advertis­
ing, aligning with the evolving nature of the gaming industry and user expectations.

Dimension Analysis and Proposal for Intrinsic Display (Power of Two):

-  To ensure that text is legible, we suggest that any creative on mobile platforms should
have a minimum height of 64px.

-  To ensure high-quality imagery, we recommend a minimum height of 128 pixels for any
creative that only contains images or logos.

-  To ensure optimal performance for desktop, console, and AAA g ames, we advise a
minimum height/width of 256 pixels.

-  Use the Power of 2 for determining minimum image asset sizes can enhance future quality
improvements.

-  The suggested alteration provides additional image quality while maintaining the same
runtime render cost. In-game rendering consumes the same amount of device power,
regardless of pixel filling.

IAB Intrinsic In-Game Advertising Creative Aspect Ratios:

|Ad Format|Buy Type|Ad Aspect Ratio|Standard Resolution|Minimum Width In-Game Resolution|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Display|Web & Mobile|2:3|1:1.5|512x341|
|Display|Web & Mobile|4:3|1.33:1|512x384|
|Display|Web & Mobile|6:1|6:1|1024x170|
|Display|Web & Mobile|8:1|8:1|1024x128|
|Video|Web & Mobile|1:1|1:1|512x512|
|Video|Web & Mobile|9:16|1:1.78|288x512|
|Video|Mobile|4:3|1.33:1|512x384|
|Video|Web & Mobile|16:9|1.78:1|512x288|



Benefits of New Aspect Ratio Guidelines:

-  The new suggested aspect ratios can contribute to a reduction in the carbon footprint and
emissions of ads, promoting environmentally responsible advertising practices.

-  Implementing these new suggested aspect ratios can improve the user experience and
foster greater adoption of the intrinsic in-game advertising format by ensuring seamless
integration of ads within the gaming environment.

-  The new suggested aspect ratios are designed to enhance ad effectiveness. They aim to
reduce download times, limit unnecessary networking, and conserve device energy, which
contributes to faster on-screen ad rendering and a more efficient overall experience.

-  Considering that in-game ads typically cover about 1.5% to 10% of screen real estate,
adopting these new suggested aspect ratios ensures that ad creatives maintain high
quality without exceeding the requirements of a full-screen resolution, thereby optimizing
both visual impact and resource usage.

These guidelines are designed to provide a flexible yet effective approach to in-game advertising,
balancing environmental concerns with technical and user experience considerations.
